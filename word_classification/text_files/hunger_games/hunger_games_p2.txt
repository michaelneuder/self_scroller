i dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm
over my calf the effect is almost magical erasing the
pain on contact leaving a pleasant cooling sensation
behind this is no herbal concoction that my mother
grinds up out of woodland plants its hightech
medicine brewed up in the capitols labs when my
calf is treated i rub a thin layer into my hands after
wrapping the pot in the parachute i nestle it safely
away in my pack now that the pain has eased its all
i can do to reposition myself in my bag before i plunge
into sleep
a bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that
a new day is dawning in the gray morning light i
examine my hands the medicine has transformed all
the angry red patches to a soft babyskin pink my leg
still feels inflamed but that burn was far deeper i
apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up
my gear whatever happens im going to have to
move and move fast i also make myself eat a cracker
and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water
almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday and
im already starting to feel the effects of hunger
below me i can see the career pack and peeta asleep
on the ground by her position leaning up against
the trunk of the tree id guess glimmer was
supposed to be on guard but fatigue overcame her
my eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next
to me but i cant make out rue since she tipped me
off it only seems fair to warn her besides if im going
to die today its rue i want to win even if it means a
little extra food for my family the idea of peeta being
crowned victor is unbearable
i call rues name in a hushed whisper and the eyes
appear wide and alert at once she points up to the

nest again i hold up my knife and make a sawing
motion she nods and disappears theres a rustling
in a nearby tree then the same noise again a bit
farther off i realize shes leaping from tree to tree its
all i can do not to laugh out loud is this what she
showed the gamemakers i imagine her flying around
the training equipment never touching the floor she
should have gotten at least a ten
rosy streaks are breaking through in the east i cant
afford to wait any longer compared to the agony of
last nights climb this one is a cinch at the tree limb
that holds the nest i position the knife in the groove
and im about to draw the teeth across the wood
when i see something moving there on the nest the
bright gold gleam of a tracker j acker lazily making its
way across the papery gray surface no question its
acting a little subdued but the wasp is up and
moving and that means the others will be out soon as
well sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands
beading up through the ointment and i do my best to
pat them dry on my shirt if i dont get through this
branch in a matter of seconds the entire swarm
could emerge and attack me
theres no sense in putting it off i take a deep breath
grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as i can
back forth back forth the tracker jackers begin to
buzz and i hear them coming out back forth back
forth a stabbing pain shoots through my knee and i
know one has found me and the others will be honing
in back forth back forth and just as the knife cuts
through i shove the end of the branch as far away
from me as i can it crashes down through the lower
branches snagging temporarily on a few but then
twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the
ground the nest bursts open like an egg and a
furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air

i feel a second sting on the cheek a third on my neck
and their venom almost immediately makes me
woozy i cling to the tree with one arm while i rip the
barbed stingers out of my flesh fortunately only
these three tracker jackers had identified me before
the nest went down the rest of the insects have
targeted their enemies on the ground
its mayhem the careers have woken to a fullscale
tracker jacker attack peeta and a few others have the
sense to drop everything and bolt i can hear cries of
to the lake to the lake and know they hope to
evade the wasps by taking to the water it must be
close if they think they can outdistance the furious
insects glimmer and another girl the one from
district 4 are not so lucky they receive multiple
stings before theyre even out of my view glimmer
appears to go completely mad shrieking and trying to
bat the wasps off with her bow which is pointless
she calls to the others for help but of course no one
returns the girl from district 4 staggers out of sight
although i wouldnt bet on her making it to the lake i
watch glimmer fall twitch hysterically around on the
ground for a few minutes and then go still
the nest is nothing but an empty shell the wasps
have vanished in pursuit of the others i dont think
theyll return but i dont want to risk it i scamper
down the tree and hit the ground running in the
opposite direction of the lake the poison from the
stingers makes me wobbly but i find my way back to
my own little pool and submerge myself in the water
just in case any wasps are still on my trail after
about five minutes i drag myself onto the rocks
people have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker
jacker stings actually the one on my knee is closer
to an orange than a plum in size a foul smelling
green liquid oozes from the places where i pulled out
the stingers

the swelling the pain the ooze watching glimmer
twitching to death on the ground its a lot to handle
before the sun has even cleared the horizon i dont
want to think about what glimmer must look like
now her body disfigured her swollen fingers
stiffening around the bow
the bow somewhere in my befuddled mind one
thought connects to another and im on my feet
teetering through the trees back to glimmer the
bow the arrows i must get them i havent heard the
cannons fire yet so perhaps glimmer is in some sort
of coma her heart still struggling against the wasp
venom but once it stops and the cannon signals her
death a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body
taking the only bow and sheath of arrows ive seen
out of the games for good and i refuse to let them
slip through my fingers again
i reach glimmer just as the cannon fires the tracker
jackers have vanished this girl so breathtakingly
beautiful in her golden dress the night of the
interviews is unrecognizable her features eradicated
her limbs three times their normal size the stinger
lumps have begun to explode spewing putrid green
liquid around her i have to break several of what
used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow
the sheath of arrows is pinned under her back i try
to roll over her body by pulling on one arm but the
flesh disintegrates in my hands and i fall back on the
ground
is this real or have the hallucinations begun i
squeeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my
mouth ordering myself not to become sick breakfast
must stay down it might be days before i can hunt
again a second cannon fires and im guessing the girl
from district 4 has just died i hear the birds fall
silent and then one give the warning call which

means a hovercraft is about to appear confused i
think its for glimmer although this doesnt quite
make sense because im still in the picture still
fighting for the arrows i lurch back onto my knees
and the trees around me begin to spin in circles in
the middle of the sky i spot the hovercraft i throw
myself over glimmers body as if to protect it but then
i see the girl from district 4 being lifted into the air
and vanishing
do this i command myself clenching my jaw i dig
my hands under glimmers body get a hold on what
must be her rib cage and force her onto her stomach
i cant help it im hyperventilating now the whole
thing is so nightmarish and im losing my grasp on
whats real i tug on the silver sheath of arrows but
its caught on something her shoulder blade
something and finally yank it free ive just encircled
the sheath with my arms when i hear the footsteps
several pairs coming through the underbrush and i
realize the careers have come back theyve come
back to kill me or get their weapons or both
but its too late to run i pull a slimy arrow from the
sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but
instead of one string i see three and the stench from
the stings is so repulsive i cant do it i cant do it i
cant do it
im helpless as the first hunter crashes through the
trees spear lifted poised to throw the shock on
peetas face makes no sense to me i wait for the blow
instead his arm drops to his side
what are you still doing here he hisses at me i
stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips
off a sting under his ear his whole body starts
sparkling as if hes been dipped in dew are you
mad hes prodding me with the shaft of the spear

now get up get up i rise but hes still pushing at
me what what is going on he shoves me away
from him hard runfhe screams run
behind him cato slashes his way through the brush
hes sparkling wet too and badly stung under one
eye i catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do
as peeta says holding tightly to my bow and arrows
banging into trees that appear out of nowhere
tripping and falling as i try to keep my balance back
past my pool and into unfamiliar woods the world
begins to bend in alarming ways a butterfly balloons
to the size of a house then shatters into a million
stars trees transform to blood and splash down over
my boots ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on
my hands and i cant shake them free theyre
climbing up my arms my neck someones
screaming a long high pitched scream that never
breaks for breath i have a vague idea it might be me
i trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange
bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest
tucking my knees up to my chin i wait for death
sick and disoriented im able to form only one
thought peeta mellark just saved my life
then the ants bore into my eyes and i black out

i enter a nightmare from which i wake repeatedly only
to find a greater terror awaiting me all the things i
dread most all the things i dread for others manifest
in such vivid detail i cant help but believe theyre
real each time i wake i think at last this is over
but it isnt its only the beginning of a new chapter of
torture how many ways do i watch prim die relive
my fathers last moments feel my own body ripped
apart this is the nature of the tracker jacker venom
so carefully created to target the place where fear lives
in your brain
when i finally do come to my senses i lie still waiting
for the next onslaught of imagery but eventually i
accept that the poison must have finally worked its
way out of my system leaving my body wracked and
feeble im still lying on my side locked in the fetal
position i lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound
untouched by ants that never existed simply
stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort
so many parts of me hurt it doesnt seem worthwhile
taking inventory of them very very slowly i manage
to sit up im in a shallow hole not filled with the
humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but
with old dead leaves my clothings damp but i dont
know whether pond water dew rain or sweat is the
cause for a long time all i can do is take tiny sips
from my bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of
a honeysuckle bush
how long have i been out it was morning when i lost
reason now its afternoon but the stiffness in my
joints suggests more than a day has passed even two
possibly if so 111 have no way of knowing which
tributes survived that tracker jacker attack not

glimmer or the girl from district 4 but there was the
boy from district 1 both tributes from district 2 and
peeta did they die from the stings certainly if they
lived their last days must have been as horrid as my
own and what about rue shes so small it wouldnt
take much venom to do her in but then again  the
tracker j ackers wouldve had to catch her and she
had a good head start
a foul rotten taste pervades my mouth and the water
has little effect on it i drag myself over to the
honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower i gently pull
the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of
nectar on my tongue the sweetness spreads through
my mouth down my throat warming my veins with
memories of summer and my home woods and gales
presence beside me for some reason our discussion
from that last morning comes back to me
we could do it you know
what
leave the district run off live in the woods you
and i we could make it
and suddenly im not thinking of gale but of peeta
and  peeta he saved my life i think because by
the time we met up i couldnt tell what was real and
what the tracker j acker venom had caused me to
imagine but if he did and my instincts tell me he
did what for is he simply working the lover boy
angle he initiated at the interview or was he actually
trying to protect me and if he was what was he
doing with those careers in the first place none of it
makes sense
i wonder what gale made of the incident for a
moment and then i push the whole thing out of my

mind because for some reason gale and peeta do not
coexist well together in my thoughts
so i focus on the one really good thing thats
happened since i landed in the arena i have a bow
and arrows a full dozen arrows if you count the one i
retrieved in the tree they bear no trace of the
noxious green slime that came from glimmers body
— which leads me to believe that might not have been
wholly real — but they have a fair amount of dried
blood on them i can clean them later but i do take a
minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree they are
more like the weapons in the training center than my
ones at home but who cares that i can work with
the weapons give me an entirely new perspective on
the games i know i have tough opponents left to
face but i am no longer merely prey that runs and
hides or takes desperate measures if cato broke
through the trees right now i wouldnt flee id shoot
i find im actually anticipating the moment with
pleasure
but first i have to get some strength back in my
body im very dehydrated again and my water supply
is dangerously low the little padding i was able to
put on by gorging myself during prep time in the
capitol is gone plus several more pounds as well my
hip bones and ribs are more prominent than i
remember them being since those awful months after
my fathers death and then there are my wounds to
contend with — burns cuts and bruises from
smashing into the trees and three tracker jacker
stings which are as sore and swollen as ever i treat
my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on
my stings as well but it has no effect on them my
mother knew a treatment for them some type of leaf
that could draw out the poison but she seldom had

cause to use it and i dont even remember its name
let alone its appearance
water first i think you can hunt along the way now
its easy to see the direction i came from by the path
of destruction my crazed body made through the
foliage so i walk off in the other direction hoping my
enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker
j acker venom
i cant move too quickly my joints reject any abrupt
motions but i establish the slow hunters tread i use
when tracking game within a few minutes i spot a
rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow
its not my usual clean shot through the eye but 111
take it after about an hour i find a stream shallow
but wide and more than sufficient for my needs the
suns hot and severe so while i wait for my water to
purify i strip down to my underclothes and wade into
the mild current im filthy from head to toe i try
splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the
water for a few minutes letting it wash off the soot
and blood and skin that has started to peel off my
burns after rinsing out my clothes and hanging them
on bushes to dry i sit on the bank in the sun for a
bit untangling my hair with my fingers my appetite
returns and i eat a cracker and a strip of beef with a
handful of moss i polish the blood from my silver
weapons
refreshed i treat my burns again braid back my
hair and dress in the damp clothes knowing the sun
will dry them soon enough following the stream
against its current seems the smartest course of
action im traveling uphill now which i prefer with a
source of fresh water not only for myself but possible
game i easily take out a strange bird that must be
some form of wild turkey anyway it looks plenty
edible to me by late afternoon i decide to build a

small fire to cook the meat betting that dusk will help
conceal the smoke and i can quench the fire by
nightfall i clean the game taking extra care with the
bird but theres nothing alarming about it once the
feathers are plucked its no bigger than a chicken
but its plump and firm ive just placed the first lot
over the coals when i hear the twig snap
in one motion i turn to the sound bringing the bow
and arrow to my shoulder theres no one there no
one i can see anyway then i spot the tip of a childs
boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree
my shoulders relax and i grin she can move through
the woods like a shadow you have to give her that
how else could she have followed me the words
come out of my mouth before i can stop them
you know theyre not the only ones who can form
alliances i say
for a moment no response then one of rues eyes
edges around the trunk you want me for an ally
why not you saved me with those tracker j ackers
youre smart enough to still be alive and i cant seem
to shake you anyway i say she blinks at me trying
to decide you hungry i can see her swallow hard
her eye flickering to the meat come on then ive had
two kills today
rue tentatively steps out into the open i can fix your
stings
can you i ask how
she digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a
handful of leaves im almost certain theyre the ones
my mother uses where d you find those

just around we all carry them when we work in the
orchards they left a lot of nests there says rue
there are a lot here too
thats right youre district eleven agriculture i
say orchards huh that must be how you can fly
around the trees like youve got wings rue smiles
ive landed on one of the few things shell admit pride
in well come on then fix me up
i plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to
reveal the sting on my knee to my surprise rue
places the handful of leaves into her mouth and
begins to chew them my mother would use other
methods but its not like we have a lot of options
after a minute or so rue presses a gloppy green wad
of chewed leaves and spit on my knee
ohhh the sound comes out of my mouth before i
can stop it its as if the leaves are actually leaching
the pain right out of the sting
rue gives a giggle lucky you had the sense to pull
the stingers out or youd be a lot worse
do my neck do my cheek i almost beg
rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth
and soon im laughing because the relief is so sweet i
notice a long burn on rues forearm ive got
something for that i set aside my weapons and
anoint her arm with the burn medicine
you have good sponsors she says longingly
have you gotten anything yet i ask she shakes her
head you will though watch the closer we get to
the end the more people will realize how clever you
are i turn the meat over

you werent joking about wanting me for an ally
she asks
no i meant it i say i can almost hear haymitch
groaning as i team up with this wispy child but i
want her because shes a survivor and i trust her
and why not admit it she reminds me of prim
okay she says and holds out her hand we
shakeits a deal
of course this kind of deal can only be temporary
but neither of us mentions that
rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy
root to the meal roasted over the fire they have the
sharp sweet taste of a parsnip she recognizes the
bird too some wild thing they call a groosling in her
district she says sometimes a flock will wander into
the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day for
a while all conversation stops as we fill our
stomachs the groosling has delicious meal thats so
fatty the grease drips down your face when you bite
into it
oh says rue with a sigh ive never had a whole leg
to myself before
ill bet she hasnt ill bet meat hardly ever comes her
way take the other i say
really she asks
take whatever you want now that ive got a bow and
arrows i can get more plus ive got snares i can
show you how to set them i say rue still looks
uncertainly at the leg oh take it i say putting the
drumstick in her hands it will only keep a few days
anyway and weve got the whole bird plus the

rabbit once shes got hold of it her appetite wins out
and she takes a huge mouthful
id have thought in district eleven youd have a bit
more to eat than us you know since you grow the
food i say
rues eyes widen oh no were not allowed to eat
the crops
they arrest you or something i ask
they whip you and make everyone else watch says
rue the mayors very strict about it
i can tell by her expression that its not that
uncommon an occurrence a public whippings a rare
thing in district 12 although occasionally one occurs
technically gale and i could be whipped on a daily
basis for poaching in the woods — well technically
we could get a whole lot worse — except all the
officials buy our meat besides our mayor madges
father doesnt seem to have much taste for such
events maybe being the least prestigious poorest
most ridiculed district in the country has its
advantages such as being largely ignored by the
capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas
do you get all the coal you want rue asks
no i answer just what we buy and whatever we
track in on our boots
they feed us a bit extra during harvest so that
people can keep going longer says rue
dont you have to be in school i ask
not during harvest everyone works then says rue

its interesting hearing about her life we have so
little communication with anyone outside our district
in fact i wonder if the gamemakers are blocking out
our conversation because even though the
information seems harmless they dont want people
in different districts to know about one another
at rues suggestion we lay out all our food to plan
ahead shes seen most of mine but i add the last
couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile shes
gathered quite a collection of roots nuts greens and
even some berries
i roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers you sure this
is safe
oh yes we have them back home ive been eating
them for days she says popping a handful in her
mouth i tentatively bite into one and its as good as
our blackberries taking rue on as an ally seems a
better choice all the time we divide up our food
supplies so in case were separated well both be set
for a few days apart from the food rue has a small
water skin a homemade slingshot and an extra pair
of socks she also has a sharp shard of rock she uses
as a knife i know its not much she says as if
embarrassed but i had to get away from the
cornucopia fast
you did just right i say when i spread out my gear
she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses
how did you get those she asks
in my pack theyve been useless so far they dont
block the sun and they make it harder to see i say
with a shrug

these arent for sun theyre for darkness exclaims
rue sometimes when we harvest through the night
theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in
the trees where the torchlight doesnt reach one
time this boy martin he tried to keep his pair hid it
in his pants they killed him on the spot
they killed a boy for taking these i say
yes and everyone knew he was no danger martin
wasnt right in the head i mean he still acted like a
threeyearold he just wanted the glasses to play
with says rue
hearing this makes me feel like district 12 is some
sort of safe haven of course people keel over from
starvation all the time but i cant imagine the
peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child
theres a little girl one of greasy saes grandkids
who wanders around the hob shes not quite right
but shes treated as a sort of pet people toss her
scraps and things
so what do these do i ask rue taking the glasses
they let you see in complete darkness says rue
try them tonight when the sun goes down
i give rue some matches and she makes sure i have
plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again we
extinguish our fire and head upstream until its
almost nightfall
where do you sleep i ask her in the trees she
nods in just your jacket
rue holds up her extra pair of socks i have these for
my hands

i think of how cold the nights have been you can
share my sleeping bag if you want well both easily
fit her face lights up i can tell this is more than she
dared hope for
we pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the
night just as the anthem begins to play there were
no deaths today
rue i only woke up today how many nights did i
missthe anthem should block out our words but
still i whisper i even take the precaution of covering
my lips with my hand i dont want the audience to
know what im planning to tell her about peeta
taking a cue from me she does the same
two she says the girls from districts one and
four are dead theres ten of us left
something strange happened at least i think it did
it might have been the tracker j acker venom making
me imagine things i say you know the boy from my
district peeta i think he saved my life but he was
with the careers
hes not with them now she says ive spied on
their base camp by the lake they made it back before
they collapsed from the stingers but hes not there
maybe he did save you and had to run
i dont answer if in fact peeta did save me im in his
debt again and this cant be paid back if he did it
was all probably just part of his act you know to
make people think hes in love with me
oh says rue thoughtfully i didnt think that was
an act

course it is i say he worked it out with our
mentor the anthem ends and the sky goes dark
lets try out these glasses i pull out the glasses and
slip them on rue wasnt kidding i can see everything
from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling
through the bushes a good fifty feet away i could kill
it from here if i had a mind to i could kill anyone
i wonder who else got a pair of these i say
the careers have two pairs but theyve got
everything down by the lake rue says and theyre
so strong
were strong too i say just in a different way
you are you can shoot she says what can i do
you can feed yourself can they i ask
they dont need to they have all those supplies
rue says
say they didnt say the supplies were gone how
long would they last i say i mean its the hunger
games right
but katniss theyre not hungry says rue
no theyre not thats the problem i agree and for
the first time i have a plan a plan that isnt
motivated by the need for flight and evasion an
offensive plan i think were going to have to fix that
rue

rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly i know
this because as soon as the anthem finishes she
snuggles up against me and falls asleep nor do i
have any misgivings about her as i take no particular
precautions if shed wanted me dead all she would
have had to do was disappear from that tree without
pointing out the tracker jacker nest needling me at
the very back of my mind is the obvious both of us
cant win these games but since the odds are still
against either of us surviving i manage to ignore the
thought
besides im distracted by my latest idea about the
careers and their supplies somehow rue and i must
find a way to destroy their food im pretty sure
feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle
traditionally the career tributes strategy is to get
hold of all the food early on and work from there the
years when they have not protected it well — one year
a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it another a
gamemakers flood washed it away — those are
usually the years that tributes from other districts
have won that the careers have been better red
growing up is actually to their disadvantage because
they dont know how to be hungry not the way rue
and i do
but im too exhausted to begin any detailed plan
tonight my wounds recovering my mind still a bit
foggy from the venom and the warmth of rue at my
side her head cradled on my shoulder have given me
a sense of security i realize for the first time how
very lonely ive been in the arena how comforting the
presence of another human being can be i give in to
my drowsiness resolving that tomorrow the tables

will turn tomorrow its the careers who will have to
watch their backs
the boom of the cannon jolts me awake the skys
streaked with light the birds already chattering rue
perches in a branch across from me her hands
cupping something we wait listening for more shots
but there arent any
who do you think that was i cant help thinking of
peeta
i dont know it could have been any of the
others says rue i guess well know tonight
whos left again i ask
the boy from district one both tributes from two
the boy from three thresh and me and you and
peeta says rue thats eight wait and the boy from
ten the one with the bad leg he makes nine
theres someone else but neither of us can remember
who it is
i wonder how that last one died says rue
no telling but its good for us a death should hold
the crowd for a bit maybe well have time to do
something before the gamemakers decide things have
been moving too slowly i say whats in your
hands
breakfast says rue she holds them out revealing
two big eggs
what kind are those i ask

not sure theres a marshy area over that way some
kind of waterbird she says
itd be nice to cook them but neither of us wants to
risk a fire my guess is the tribute who died today was
a victim of the careers which means theyve
recovered enough to be back in the games we each
suck out the insides of an egg eat a rabbit leg and
some berries its a good breakfast anywhere
ready to do it i say pulling on my pack
do what says rue but by the way she bounces up
you can tell shes up for whatever i propose
today we take out the careers food i say
really how you can see the glint of excitement in
her eyes in this way shes exactly the opposite of
prim for whom adventures are an ordeal
no idea come on well figure out a plan while we
hunt i say
we dont get much hunting done though because im
too busy getting every scrap of information i can out
of rue about the careers base shes only been in to
spy on them briefly but shes observant they have
set up their camp beside the lake their supply stash
is about thirty yards away during the day theyve
been leaving another tribute the boy from district 3
to watch over the supplies
the boy from district three i ask hes working
with them
yes he stays at the camp fulltime he got stung
too when they drew the tracker j ackers in by the

lake says rue i guess they agreed to let him live if
he acted as their guard but hes not very big
what weapons does he have i ask
not much that i could see a spear he might be able
to hold a few of us off with that but thresh could kill
him easilysays rue
and the foods just out in the open i say she
nods somethings not quite right about that whole
setup
i know but i couldnt tell what exactly says
ruekatniss even if you could get to the food how
would you get rid of it
burn it dump it in the lake soak it in fuel i poke
rue in the belly just like i would prim eat it she
giggles dont worry 111 think of something
destroying things is much easier than making them
for a while we dig roots we gather berries and
greens we devise a strategy in hushed voices and i
come to know rue the oldest of six kids fiercely
protective of her siblings who gives her rations to the
younger ones who forages in the meadows in a
district where the peacekeepers are far less obliging
than ours rue who when you ask her what she loves
most in the world replies of all things music
music i say in our world i rank music somewhere
between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of
usefulness at least a rainbow gives you a tip about
the weather you have a lot of time for that
we sing at home at work too thats why i love your
pin she says pointing to the mockingjay that ive
again forgotten about

you have mocking ays i ask
oh yes i have a few that are my special friends we
can sing back and forth for hours they carry
messages for me she says
what do you mean i say
im usually up highest so im the first to see the flag
that signals quitting time theres a special little song
i do says rue she opens her mouth and sings a
little fournote run in a sweet clear voice and the
mockingj ays spread it around the orchard thats how
everyone knows to knock off she continues they
can be dangerous though if you get too near their
nests but you cant blame them for that
i unclasp the pin and hold it out to her here you
take it it has more meaning for you than me
oh no says rue closing my fingers back over the
pin i like to see it on you thats how i decided i
could trust you besides i have this she pulls a
necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her
shirt on it hangs a roughly carved wooden star or
maybe its a flower its a good luck charm
well its worked so far i say pinning the
mockingjay back on my shirt maybe you should just
stick with that
by lunch we have a plan by early afternoon we are
poised to carry it out i help rue collect and place the
wood for the first two campfires the third shell have
time for on her own we decide to meet afterward at
the site where we ate our first meal together the
stream should help guide me back to it before i
leave i make sure rues well stocked with food and

matches i even insist she take my sleeping bag in
case its not possible to rendezvous by nightfall
what about you wont you be cold she asks
not if i pick up another bag down by the lake i
say you know stealing isnt illegal here i say with a
grin
at the last minute rue decides to teach me her
mockingj ay signal the one she gives to indicate the
days work is done it might not work but if you hear
the mockingjays singing it youll know im okay only
i cant get back right away
are there many mockingjays here i ask
havent you seen them theyve got nests
everywhere she says i have to admit i havent
noticed
okay then if all goes according to plan 111 see you
for dinner i say
unexpectedly rue throws her arms around me i only
hesitate a moment before i hug her back
you be careful she says to me
you too i say i turn and head back to the stream
feeling somehow worried about rue being killed
about rue not being killed and the two of us being left
for last about leaving rue alone about leaving prim
alone back home no prim has my mother and gale
and a baker who has promised she wont go hungry
rue has only me
once i reach the stream i have only to follow it
downhill to the place i initially picked it up after the

tracker jacker attack i have to be cautious as i move
along the water though because i find my thoughts
preoccupied with unanswered questions most of
which concern peeta the cannon that fired early this
morning did that signify his death if so how did he
die at the hand of a career and was that in revenge
for letting me live i struggle again to remember that
moment over glimmers body when he burst through
the trees but just the fact that he was sparkling
leads me to doubt everything that happened
i must have been moving very slowly yesterday
because i reach the shallow stretch where i took my
bath in just a few hours i stop to replenish my water
and add a layer of mud to my backpack it seems
bent on reverting to orange no matter how many
times i cover it
my proximity to the careers camp sharpens my
senses and the closer i get to them the more
guarded i am pausing frequently to listen for
unnatural sounds an arrow already fitted into the
string of my bow i dont see any other tributes but i
do notice some of the things rue has mentioned
patches of the sweet berries a bush with the leaves
that healed my stings clusters of tracker jacker nests
in the vicinity of the tree i was trapped in and here
and there the blackandwhite flash of a mockingjay
wing in the branches high over my head
when i reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the
foot i pause a moment to gather my courage rue
has given specific instructions on how to reach the
best spying place near the lake from this point
remember i tell myself youre the hunter now not
them i get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on i
make it to the copse rue has told me about and again
have to admire her cleverness its right at the edge of
the wood but the bushy foliage is so thick down low i

can easily observe the career camp without being
spotted between us lies the flat expanse where the
games began
there are four tributes the boy from district 1 cato
and the girl from district 2 and a scrawny ashen
skinned boy who must be from district 3 he made
almost no impression on me at all during our time in
the capitol i can remember almost nothing about
him not his costume not his training score not his
interview even now as he sits there fiddling with
some kind of plastic box hes easily ignored in the
presence of his large and domineering companions
but he must be of some value or they wouldnt have
bothered to let him live still seeing him only adds to
my sense of unease over why the careers would
possibly leave him as a guard why they have allowed
him to live at all
all four tributes seem to still be recovering from the
tracker jacker attack even from here i can see the
large swollen lumps on their bodies they must not
have had the sense to remove the stingers or if they
did not known about the leaves that healed them
apparently whatever medicines they found in the
cornucopia have been ineffective
the cornucopia sits in its original position but its
insides have been picked clean most of the supplies
held in crates burlap sacks and plastic bins are
piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a
questionable distance from the camp others are
sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid
almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the
cornucopia at the onset of the games a canopy of
netting that aside from discouraging birds seems to
be useless shelters the pyramid itself

the whole setup is completely perplexing the
distance the netting and the presence of the boy
from district 3 one things for sure destroying those
supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks some
other factor is at play here and id better stay put
until i figure out what it is my guess is the pyramid
is boobytrapped in some manner i think of
concealed pits descending nets a thread that when
broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart
really the possibilities are endless
while i am mulling over my options i hear cato shout
out hes pointing up to the woods far beyond me
and without turning i know that rue must have set
the first campfire wed made sure to gather enough
green wood to make the smoke noticeable the
careers begin to arm themselves at once
an argument breaks out its loud enough for me to
hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from
district 3 should stay or accompany them
hes coming we need him in the woods and his
jobs done here anyway no one can touch those
supplies says cato
what about lover boy says the boy from district 1
i keep telling you forget about him i know where i
cut him its a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet at
any rate hes in no shape to raid us says cato
so peeta is out there in the woods wounded badly
but i am still in the dark on what motivated him to
betray the careers
come on says cato he thrusts a spear into the
hands of the boy from district 3 and they head off in
the direction of the fire the last thing i hear as they

enter the woods is cato saying when we find her i
kill her in my own way and no one interferes
somehow i dont think hes talking about rue she
didnt drop a nest of tracker jackers on him
i stay put for a half an hour or so trying to figure out
what to do about the supplies the one advantage i
have with the bow and arrow is distance i could send
a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough — im
a good enough shot to get it through those openings
in the net — but theres no guarantee it would catch
more likely itd just burn itself out and then what id
have achieved nothing and given them far too much
information about myself that i was here that i have
an accomplice that i can use the bow and arrow with
accuracy
theres no alternative im going to have to get in
closer and see if i cant discover what exactly protects
the supplies in fact im just about to reveal myself
when a movement catches my eye several hundred
yards to my right i see someone emerge from the
woods for a second i think its rue but then i
recognize foxface — shes the one we couldnt
remember this morning — creeping out onto the plain
when she decides its safe she runs for the pyramid
with quick small steps just before she reaches the
circle of supplies that have been littered around the
pyramid she stops searches the ground and
carefully places her feet on a spot then she begins to
approach the pyramid with strange little hops
sometimes landing on one foot teetering slightly
sometimes risking a few steps at one point she
launches up in the air over a small barrel and lands
poised on her tiptoes but she overshot slightly and
her momentum throws her forward i hear her give a
sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground but
nothing happens in a moment shes regained her

feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of
the supplies
so im right about the booby trap but its clearly
more complex than i had imagined i was right about
the girl too how wily is she to have discovered this
path into the food and to be able to replicate it so
neatly she fills her pack taking a few items from a
variety of containers crackers from a crate a handful
of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended
from a rope off the side of a bin but only a handful
from each not enough to tip off that the food is
missing not enough to cause suspicion and then
shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle
and scampering into the woods again safe and
sound
i realize im grinding my teeth in frustration foxface
has confirmed what id already guessed but what
sort of trap have they laid that requires such
dexterity has so many trigger points why did she
squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth
youd have thought  and slowly it begins to dawn on
me  youd have thought the very ground was going
to explode
its mined i whisper that explains everything the
careers willingness to leave their supplies foxfaces
reaction the involvement of the boy from district 3
where they have the factories where they make
televisions and automobiles and explosives but
where did he get them in the supplies thats not
the sort of weapon the gamemakers usually provide
given that they like to see the tributes draw blood
personally i slip out of the bushes and cross to one of
the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the
arena the ground around it has been dug up and
patted back down the land mines were disabled after
the sixty seconds we stood on the plates but the boy

from district 3 must have managed to reactivate
them ive never seen anyone in the games do that i
bet it came as a shock even to the gamemakers
well hurray for the boy from district 3 for putting
one over on them but what am i supposed to do
now obviously i cant go strolling into that mess
without blowing myself skyhigh as for sending in a
burning arrow thats more laughable than ever the
mines are set off by pressure it doesnt have to be a
lot either one year a girl dropped her token a small
wooden ball while she was at her plate and they
literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground
my arms pretty good i might be able to chuck some
rocks in there and set off what maybe one mine
that could start a chain reaction or could it would
the boy from district 3 have placed the mines in such
a way that a single mine would not disturb the
others thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring
the death of the invader even if i only blew up one
mine id draw the careers back down on me for sure
and anyway what am i thinking theres that net
clearly strung to deflect any such attack besides
what id really need is to throw about thirty rocks in
there at once setting off a big chain reaction
demolishing the whole lot
i glance back up at the woods the smoke from rues
second fire is wafting toward the sky by now the
careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of
trick time is running out
there is a solution to this i know there is if i can
only focus hard enough i stare at the pyramid the
bins the crates too heavy to topple over with an
arrow maybe one contains cooking oil and the
burning arrow idea is reviving when i realize i could
end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a

direct hit on an oil bin since id just be guessing im
genuinely thinking of trying to recreate foxfaces trip
up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of
destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of
apples i could sever the rope in one shot didnt i do
as much in the training center its a big bag but it
still might only be good for one explosion if only i
could free the apples themselves
i know what to do i move into range and give myself
three arrows to get the job done i place my feet
carefully block out the rest of the world as i take
meticulous aim the first arrow tears through the side
of the bag near the top leaving a split in the burlap
the second widens it to a gaping hole i can see the
first apple teetering when i let the third arrow go
catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from
the bag
for a moment everything seems frozen in time then
the apples spill to the ground and im blown
backward into the air

the impact with the hardpacked earth of the plain
knocks the wind out of me my backpack does little to
soften the blow fortunately my quiver has caught in
the crook of my elbow sparing both itself and my
shoulder and my bow is locked in my grasp the
ground still shakes with explosions i cant hear them
i cant hear anything at the moment but the apples
must have set off enough mines causing debris to
activate the others i manage to shield my face with
my arms as shattered bits of matter some of it
burning rain down around me an acrid smoke fills
the air which is not the best remedy for someone
trying to regain the ability to breathe
after about a minute the ground stops vibrating i
roll on my side and allow myself a moment of
satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that
was recently the pyramid the careers arent likely to
salvage anything out of that
id better get out of here i think they 11 be making a
beeline for the place but once im on my feet i realize
escape may not be so simple im dizzy not the
slightly wobbly kind but the kind that sends the
trees swooping around you and causes the earth to
move in waves under your feet
i take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands
and knees i wait a few minutes to let it pass but it
doesnt
panic begins to set in i cant stay here flight is
essential but i can neither walk nor hear i place a
hand to my left ear the one that was turned toward
the blast and it comes away bloody have i gone deaf

from the explosion the idea frightens me i rely as
much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter maybe
more at times but i cant let my fear show
absolutely positively i am live on every screen in
panem
no blood trails i tell myself and manage to pull my
hood up over my head tie the cord under my chin
with uncooperative fingers that should help soak up
the blood i cant walk but can i crawl i move
forward tentatively yes if i go very slowly i can
crawl most of the woods will offer insufficient cover
my only hope is to make it back to rues copse and
conceal myself in greenery i cant get caught out here
on my hands and knees in the open not only will i
face death its sure to be a long and painful one at
catos hand the thought of prim having to watch
that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the
hideout
another blast knocks me flat on my face a stray
mine set off by some collapsing crate this happens
twice more im reminded of those last few kernels
that burst when prim and i pop corn over the fire at
home
to say i make it in the nick of time is an
understatement i have literally just dragged myself
into the tangle of hushes at the base of the trees
when theres cato barreling onto the plain soon
followed by his companions his rage is so extreme it
might be comical — so people really do tear out their
hair and beat the ground with their fists — if i didnt
know that it was aimed at me at what i have done to
him add to that my proximity my inability to run or
defend myself and in fact the whole thing has me
terrified im glad my hiding place makes it impossible
for the cameras to get a close shot of me because im
biting my nails like theres no tomorrow gnawing off

the last bits of nail polish trying to keep my teeth
from chattering
the boy from district 3 throws stones into the ruins
and must have declared all the mines activated
because the careers are approaching the wreckage
cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and
takes out his anger on the smoking remains by
kicking open various containers the other tributes
are poking around in the mess looking for anything
to salvage but theres nothing the boy from district
3 has done his job too well this idea must occur to
cato too because he turns on the boy and appears
to be shouting at him the boy from district 3 only
has time to turn and run before cato catches him in a
headlock from behind i can see the muscles ripple in
catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the
side
its that quick the death of the boy from district 3
the other two careers seem to be trying to calm cato
down i can tell he wants to return to the woods but
they keep pointing at the sky which puzzles me until
i realize of course they think whoever set off the
explosions is dead
they dont know about the arrows and the apples
they assume the booby trap was faulty but that the
tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it if
there was a cannon shot it could have been easily
lost in the subsequent explosions the shattered
remains of the thief removed by hovercraft they
retire to the far side of the lake to allow the
gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from
district 3 and they wait

i suppose a cannon goes off a hovercraft appears and
takes the dead boy the sun dips below the horizon
night falls up in the sky i see the seal and know the
anthem must have begun a moment of darkness
they show the boy from district 3 they show the boy
from district 10 who must have died this morning
then the seal reappears so now they know the
bomber survived in the seals light i can see cato
and the girl from district 2 put on their nightvision
glasses the boy from district 1 ignites a tree branch
for a torch illuminating the grim determination on all
their faces the careers stride back into the woods to
hunt
the dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is
still deafened i can hear a ringing in my right which
seems a good sign theres no point in leaving my
hiding place though im about as safe as i can be
here at the crime scene they probably think the
bomber has a two or threehour lead on them still
its a long time before i risk moving
the first thing i do is dig out my own glasses and put
them on which relaxes me a little to have at least
one of my hunters senses working i drink some
water and wash the blood from my ear fearing the
smell of meat will draw unwanted predators — fresh
blood is bad enough — i make a good meal out of the
greens and roots and berries rue and i gathered
today
where is my little ally did she make it back to the
rendezvous point is she worried about me at least
the sky has shown were both alive
i run through the surviving tributes on my fingers
the boy from 1 both from 2 foxface both from 1 1
and 12 just eight of us the betting must be getting
really hot in the capitol theyll be doing special

features on each of us now probably interviewing our
friends and families its been a long time since a
tribute from district 12 made it into the top eight
and now there are two of us although from what
cato said peetas on his way out not that cato is the
final word on anything didnt he just lose his entire
stash of supplies
let the seventyfourth hunger games begin cato i
think let them begin for real
a cold breeze has sprung up i reach for my sleeping
bag before i remember i left it with rue i was
supposed to pick up another one but what with the
mines and all i forgot i begin to shiver since
roosting overnight in a tree isnt sensible anyway i
scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover
myself with leaves and pine needles im still freezing
i lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and
position my backpack to block the wind its a little
better i begin to have more sympathy for the girl from
district 8 that lit the fire that first night but now its
me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until
morning more leaves more pine needles i pull my
arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my
chest somehow i drift off to sleep
when i open my eyes the world looks slightly
fractured and it takes a minute to realize that the
sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my
vision as i sit up and remove them i hear a laugh
somewhere near the lake and freeze the laughs
distorted but the fact that it registered at all means i
must be regaining my hearing yes my right ear can
hear again although its still ringing as for my left
ear well at least the bleeding has stopped
i peer through the bushes afraid the careers have
returned trapping me here for an indefinite time no

its foxface standing in the rubble of the pyramid
and laughing shes smarter than the careers
actually finding a few useful items in the ashes a
metal pot a knife blade im perplexed by her
amusement until i realize that with the careers
stores eliminated she might actually stand a chance
just like the rest of us it crosses my mind to reveal
myself and enlist her as a second ally against that
pack but i rule it out theres something about that
sly grin that makes me sure that befriending foxface
would ultimately get me a knife in the back with that
in mind this might be an excellent time to shoot her
but shes heard something not me because her head
turns away toward the dropoff and she sprints for
the woods i wait no one nothing shows up still if
foxface thought it was dangerous maybe its time for
me to get out of here too besides im eager to tell
rue about the pyramid
since ive no idea where the careers are the route
back by the stream seems as good as any i hurry
loaded bow in one hand a hunk of cold groosling in
the other because im famished now and not just for
leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the
meat the trip to the stream is uneventful once
there i refill my water and wash taking particular
care with my injured ear then i travel uphill using
the stream as a guide at one point i find boot prints
in the mud along the bank the careers have been
here but not for a while the prints are deep because
they were made in soft mud but now theyre nearly
dry in the hot sun i havent been careful enough
about my own tracks counting on a light tread and
the pine needles to conceal my prints now i strip off
my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the
stream
the cool water has an invigorating effect on my body
my spirits i shoot two fish easy pickings in this slow

moving stream and go ahead and eat one raw even
though ive just had the groosling the second ill save
for rue
gradually subtly the ringing in my right ear
diminishes until its gone entirely i find myself
pawing at my left ear periodically trying to clean
away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds if
theres improvement its undetectable i cant adjust
to deafness in the ear it makes me feel offbalanced
and defenseless to my left blind even my head keeps
turning to the injured side as my right ear tries to
compensate for the wall of nothingness where
yesterday there was a constant flow of information
the more time that passes the less hopeful i am that
this is an injury that will heal
when i reach the site of our first meeting i feel
certain its been undisturbed theres no sign of rue
not on the ground or in the trees this is odd by now
she should have returned as its midday
undoubtedly she spent the night in a tree
somewhere what else could she do with no light and
the careers with their nightvision glasses tramping
around the woods and the third fire she was
supposed to set — although i forgot to check for it
last night — was the farthest from our site of all
shes probably just being cautious about making her
way back i wish shed hurry because i dont want to
hang around here too long i want to spend the
afternoon traveling to higher ground hunting as we
go but theres nothing really for me to do but wait
i wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean
my evergrowing list of wounds the burns are much
better but i use a bit of medicine on them anyway
the main thing to worry about now is keeping out
infection i go ahead and eat the second fish it isnt
going to last long in this hot sun but it should be

easy enough to spear a few more for rue if she would
just show up
feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my
lopsided hearing i scale a tree to wait if the careers
show up this will be a fine place to shoot them from
the sun moves slowly i do things to pass the time
chew leaves and apply them to my stings that are
deflated but still tender comb through my damp hair
with my fingers and braid it lace my boots back up
check over my bow and remaining nine arrows test
my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf
near it but without good results
despite the groosling and the fish my stomachs
growling and i know im going to have what we call a
hollow day back in district 12 thats a day where no
matter what you put in your belly its never enough
having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse
so i decide to give into it after all ive lost a lot of
weight in the arena i need some extra calories and
having the bow and arrows makes me far more
confident about my future prospects
i slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts my last
cracker the groosling neck thats good because it
takes time to pick clean finally a groosling wing and
the bird is history but its a hollow day and even
with all that i start daydreaming about food
particularly the decadent dishes served in the capitol
the chicken in creamy orange sauce the cakes and
pudding bread with butter noodles in green sauce
the lamb and dried plum stew i suck on a few mint
leaves and tell myself to get over it mint is good
because we drink mint tea after supper often so it
tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over
sort of

dangling up in the tree with the sun warming me a
mouthful of mint my bow and arrows at hand    this
is the most relaxed ive been since ive entered the
arena if only rue would show up and we could clear
out as the shadows grow so does my restlessness
by late afternoon ive resolved to go looking for her i
can at least visit the spot where she set the third fire
and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts
before i go i scatter a few mint leaves around our old
camp fire since we gathered these some distance
away rue will understand ive been here while theyll
mean nothing to the careers
in less than an hour im at the place where we agreed
to have the third fire and i know something has gone
amiss the wood has been neatly arranged expertly
interspersed with tinder but it has never been lit
rue set up the fire but never made it back here
somewhere between the second column of smoke i
spied before i blew up the supplies and this point she
ran into trouble
i have to remind myself shes still alive or is she
could the cannon shot announcing her death have
come in the wee hours of the morning when even my
good ear was too broken to pick it up will she
appear in the sky tonight no i refuse to believe it
there could be a hundred other explanations she
could have lost her way run into a pack of predators
or another tribute like thresh and had to hide
whatever happened im almost certain shes stuck
out there somewhere between the second fire and the
unlit one at my feet something is keeping her up a
tree
i think ill go hunt it down

its a relief to be doing something after sitting around
all afternoon i creep silently through the shadows
letting them conceal me but nothing seems
suspicious theres no sign of any kind of struggle no
disruption of the needles on the ground ive stopped
for just a moment when i hear it i have to cock my
head around to the side to be sure but there it is
again rues fournote tune coming out of a
mockingj ays mouth the one that means shes all
right
i grin and move in the direction of the bird another
just a short distance ahead picks up on the handful
of notes rue has been singing to them and recently
otherwise theyd have taken up some other song my
eyes lift up into the trees searching for a sign of her i
swallow and sing softly back hoping shell know its
safe to join me a mockingj ay repeats the melody to
me and thats when i hear the scream
its a childs scream a young girls scream theres no
one in the arena capable of making that sound except
rue and now im running knowing this may be a
trap knowing the three careers may be poised to
attack me but i cant help myself theres another
highpitched cry this time my name katniss
katniss
rue i shout back so she knows im near so they
know im near and hopefully the girl who has
attacked them with tracker j ackers and gotten an
eleven they still cant explain will be enough to pull
their attention away from her rue im coming
when i break into the clearing shes on the ground
hopelessly entangled in a net she just has time to
reach her hand through the mesh and say my name
before the spear enters her body

the boy from district 1 dies before he can pull out the
spear my arrow drives deeply into the center of his
neck he falls to his knees and halves the brief
remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and
drowning in his own blood im reloaded shifting my
aim from side to side while i shout at rue are there
more are there more
she has to say no several times before i hear it rue
has rolled to her side her body curved in and around
the spear i shove the boy away from her and pull out
my knife freeing her from the net one look at the
wound and i know its far beyond my capacity to heal
beyond anyones probably the spearhead is buried
up to the shaft in her stomach i crouch before her
staring helplessly at the embedded weapon theres
no point in comforting words in telling her shell be
all right shes no fool her hand reaches out and i
clutch it like a lifeline as if its me whos dying
instead of rue
you blew up the food she whispers
every last bit i say
you have to win she says
im going to going to win for both of us now i
promise i hear a cannon and look up it must be for
the boy from district 1
dont go rue tightens her grip on my hand

course not staying right here i say i move in
closer to her pulling her head onto my lap i gently
brush the dark thick hair back behind her ear
sing she says but i barely catch the word
sing i think sing whati do know a few songs
believe it or not there was once music in my house
too music i helped make my father pulled me in with
that remarkable voice — but i havent sung much
since he died except when prim is very sick then i
sing her the same songs she liked as a baby
sing my throat is tight with tears hoarse from smoke
and fatigue but if this is prims i mean rues last
request i have to at least try the song that comes to
me is a simple lullaby one we sing fretful hungry
babies to sleep with its old very old i think made up
long ago in our hills what my music teacher calls a
mountain air but the words are easy and soothing
promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this
awful piece of time we call today
i give a small cough swallow hard and begin
deep in the meadow under the willow
a bed of grass a soft green pillow
lay down your head and close your sleepy eyes
and when again they open the sun will rise
here its safe here its warm
here the daisies guard you from every harm
here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings
them true

here is the place where i love you
rues eyes have fluttered shut her chest moves but
only slightly my throat releases the tears and they
slide down my cheeks but i have to finish the song
for her
deep in the meadow hidden far away
a cloak of leaves a moonbeam ray
forget your woes and let your troubles lay
and when again its morning theyll wash away
here its safe here its warm
here the daisies guard you from every harm
the final lines are barely audible
here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings
them true
here is the place where i love you
everythings still and quiet then almost eerily the
mockingj ays take up my song
for a moment i sit there watching my tears drip
down on her face rues cannon fires i lean forward
and press my lips against her temple slowly as if not
to wake her i lay her head back on the ground and
release her hand
theyll want me to clear out now so they can collect
the bodies and theres nothing to stay for i roll the
boy from district 1 onto his face and take his pack
retrieve the arrow that ended his life i cut rues pack

from her back as well knowing shed want me to have
it but leave the spear in her stomach weapons in
bodies will be transported to the hovercraft ive no
use for a spear so the sooner its gone from the arena
the better
i cant stop looking at rue smaller than ever a baby
animal curled up in a nest of netting i cant bring
myself to leave her like this past harm but seeming
utterly defenseless to hate the boy from district 1
who also appears so vulnerable in death seems
inadequate its the capitol i hate for doing this to all
of us
gales voice is in my head his ravings against the
capitol no longer pointless no longer to be ignored
rues death has forced me to confront my own fury
against the cruelty the injustice they inflict upon us
but here even more strongly than at home i feel my
impotence theres no way to take revenge on the
capitol is there
then i remember peetas words on the roof only i
keep wishing i could think of a way to  to show the
capital they dont own me that im more than just a
piece in their games and for the first time i
understand what he means
i want to do something right here right now to
shame them to make them accountable to show the
capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there
is a part of every tribute they cant own that rue was
more than a piece in their games and so am i
a few steps into the woods grows a bank of
wildflowers perhaps they are really weeds of some
sort but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of
violet and yellow and white i gather up an armful
and come back to rues side slowly one stem at a

time i decorate her body in the flowers covering the
ugly wound wreathing her face weaving her hair
with bright colors
theyll have to show it or even if they choose to turn
the cameras elsewhere at this moment theyll have to
bring them back when they collect the bodies and
everyone will see her then and know i did it i step
back and take a last look at rue she could really be
asleep in that meadow after all
bye rue i whisper i press the three middle fingers
of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in
her direction then i walk away without looking back
the birds fall silent somewhere a mockingjay gives
the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft i
dont know how it knows it must hear things that
humans cant i pause my eyes focused on whats
ahead not whats happening behind me it doesnt
take long then the general birdsong begins again and
i know shes gone
another mockingjay a young one by the look of it
lands on a branch before me and bursts out rues
melody
my song the hovercraft were too unfamiliar for this
novice to pick up but it has mastered her handful of
notes the ones that mean shes safe
good and safe i say as i pass under its branch we
dont have to worry about her now good and safe
ive no idea where to go the brief sense of home i had
that one night with rue has vanished my feet wander
this way and that until sunset im not afraid not
even watchful which makes me an easy target
except id kill anyone i met on sight without emotion

or the slightest tremor in my hands my hatred of the
capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors
in the least especially the careers they at least
can be made to pay for rues death
no one materializes though there arent many of us
left and its a big arena soon theyll be pulling out
some other device to force us together but theres
been enough gore today perhaps well even get to
sleep
im about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp
when a silver parachute floats down and lands in
front of me a gift from a sponsor but why now ive
been in fairly good shape with supplies maybe
haymitchs noticed my despondency and is trying to
cheer me up a bit or could it be something to help
my ear
i open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread
its not the fine white capitol stuff its made of dark
ration grain and shaped in a crescent sprinkled with
seeds i flash back to peetas lesson on the various
district breads in the training center this bread
came from district 1 1  i cautiously lift the still warm
loaf what must it have cost the people of district 1 1
who cant even feed themselves how many would ve
had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the
collection for this one loaf it had been meant for
rue surely but instead of pulling the gift when she
died theyd authorized haymitch to give it to me as a
thankyou or because like me they dont like to let
debts go unpaid for whatever reason this is a first
a district gift to a tribute whos not your own
i lift my face and step into the last falling rays of
sunlight my thanks to the people of district eleven
i say i want them to know i know where it came

from that the full value of their gift has been
recognized
i climb dangerously high into a tree not for safety but
to get as far away from today as i can my sleeping
bag is rolled neatly in rues pack tomorrow ill sort
through the supplies tomorrow ill make a new plan
but tonight all i can do is strap myself in and take
tiny bites of the bread its good it tastes of home
soon the seals in the sky the anthem plays in my
right ear i see the boy from district 1 rue thats all
for tonight six of us left i think only six with the
bread still locked in my hands i fall asleep at once
sometimes when things are particularly bad my
brain will give me a happy dream a visit with my
father in the woods an hour of sunlight and cake
with prim tonight it sends me rue still decked in
her flowers perched in a high sea of trees trying to
teach me to talk to the mockingjays i see no sign of
her wounds no blood just a bright laughing girl she
sings songs ive never heard in a clear melodic voice
on and on through the night theres a drowsy in
between period when i can hear the last few strains of
her music although shes lost in the leaves when i
fully awaken im momentarily comforted i try to hold
on to the peaceful feeling of the dream but it quickly
slips away leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever
heaviness infuses my whole body as if theres liquid
lead in my veins ive lost the will to do the simplest
tasks to do anything but lie here staring
unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves for
several hours i remain motionless as usual its the
thought of prims anxious face as she watches me on
the screens back home that breaks me from my
lethargy

i give myself a series of simple commands to follow
like now you have to sit up katniss now you have
to drink water katniss i act on the orders with slow
robotic motions now you have to sort the packs
katniss
rues pack holds my sleeping bag her nearly empty
water skin a handful of nuts and roots a bit of
rabbit her extra socks and her slingshot the boy
from district 1 has several knives two spare
spearheads a flashlight a small leather pouch a
firstaid kit a full bottle of water and a pack of dried
fruit a pack of dried fruit out of all he might have
chosen from to me this is a sign of extreme
arrogance why bother to carry food when you have
such a bounty back at camp when you will kill your
enemies so quickly youll be home before youre
hungry i can only hope the other careers traveled so
lightly when it came to food and now find themselves
with nothing
speaking of which my own supply is running low i
finish off the loaf from district 1 1 and the last of the
rabbit how quickly the food disappears all i have left
are rues roots and nuts the boys dried fruit and
one strip of beef now you have to hunt katniss i tell
myself
i obediently consolidate the supplies i want into my
pack after i climb down the tree i conceal the boys
knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no
one else can use them ive lost my bearings what
with all the wandering around i did yesterday
evening but i try and head back in the general
direction of the stream i know im on course when i
come across rues third unlit fire shortly thereafter
i discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees
and take out three before they know what hit them i
return to rues signal fire and start it up not caring

about the excessive smoke where are you cato i
think as i roast the birds and rues roots im waiting
right here
who knows where the careers are now either too far
to reach me or too sure this is a trick or  is it
possible too scared of me they know i have the
bow and arrows of course cato saw me take them
from glimmers body but have they put two and two
together yet figured out i blew up the supplies and
killed their fellow career possibly they think thresh
did this wouldnt he be more likely to revenge rues
death than i would being from the same district not
that he ever took any interest in her
and what about foxface did she hang around to
watch me blow up the supplies no when i caught
her laughing in the ashes the next morning it was as
if someone had given her a lovely surprise
i doubt they think peeta has lit this signal fire catos
sure hes as good as dead i find myself wishing i
could tell peeta about the flowers i put on rue that i
now understand what he was trying to say on the
roof perhaps if he wins the games hell see me on
victors night when they replay the highlights of the
games on a screen over the stage where we did our
interviews the winner sits in a place of honor on the
platform surrounded by their support crew
but i told rue id be there for both of us and
somehow that seems even more important than the
vow i gave prim
i really think i stand a chance of doing it now
winning its not just having the arrows or
outsmarting the careers a few times although those
things help something happened when i was holding
rues hand watching the life drain out of her now i

am determined to revenge her to make her loss
unforgettable and i can only do that by winning and
thereby making myself unforgettable
i overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to
shoot but no one does maybe the other tributes are
out there beating one another senseless which would
be fine ever since the bloodbath ive been featured
on screens most than i care
eventually i wrap up my food and go back to the
stream to replenish my water and gather some but
the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me
and even though its only early evening i climb a tree
and settle in for the night my brain begins to replay
the events from yesterday i keep seeing rue speared
my arrow piercing the boys neck i dont know why i
should even care about the boy
then i realize  he was my first kill
along with other statistics they report to help people
place their bets every tribute has a list of kills i
guess technically id get credited for glimmer and the
girl from district 4 too for dumping that nest on
them but the boy from district 1 was the first person
i knew would die because of my actions numerous
animals have lost their lives at my hands but only
one human i hear gale saying how different can it
be really
amazingly similar in the execution a bow pulled an
arrow shot entirely different in the aftermath i killed
a boy whose name i dont even know somewhere his
family is weeping for him his friends call for my
blood maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed
he would come back

but then i think of rues still body and im able to
banish the boy from my mind at least for now
its been an uneventful day according to the sky no
deaths i wonder how long well get until the next
catastrophe drives us back together if its going to be
tonight i want to get some sleep first i cover my good
ear to block out the strains of the anthem but then i
hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation
for the most part the only communication the
tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly
death toll but occasionally there will be trumpets
followed by an announcement usually this will be a
call to a feast when food is scarce the gamemakers
will invite the players to a banquet somewhere
known to all like the cornucopia as an inducement
to gather and fight sometimes there is a feast and
sometimes theres nothing but a loaf of stale bread for
the tributes to compete for i wouldnt go in for the
food but this could be an ideal time to take out a few
competitors
claudius templesmiths voice booms down from
overhead congratulating the six of us who remain
but he is not inviting us to a feast hes saying
something very confusing theres been a rule change
in the games a rule change that in itself is mind
bending since we dont really have any rules to speak
of except dont step off your circle for sixty seconds
and the unspoken rule about not eating one another
under the new rule both tributes from the same
district will be declared winners if they are the last
two alive claudius pauses as if he knows were not
getting it and repeats the change again
the news sinks in two tributes can win this year if
theyre from the same district both can live both of
us can live

before i can stop myself i call out peetas name

part iii
the victor

i clap my hands over my mouth but the sound has
already escaped the sky goes black and i hear a
chorus of frogs begin to sing stupid i tell
myself what a stupid thing to do i wait frozen for
the woods to come alive with assailants then i
remember theres almost no one left
peeta whos been wounded is now my ally whatever
doubts ive had about him dissipate because if either
of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when
we returned to district 12 in fact i know if i was
watching id loathe any tribute who didnt
immediately ally with their district partner besides it
just makes sense to protect each other and in my
case — being one of the starcrossed lovers from
district 12 — its an absolute requirement if i want
any more help from sympathetic sponsors
the starcrossed lovers    peeta must have been
playing that angle all along why else would the
gamemakers have made this unprecedented change
in the rules for two tributes to have a shot at
winning our romance must be so popular with the
audience that condemning it would jeopardize the
success of the games no thanks to me all ive done
is managed not to kill peeta but whatever hes done
in the arena he must have the audience convinced it
was to keep me alive shaking his head to keep me
from running to the cornucopia fighting cato to let
me escape even hooking up with the careers must
have been a move to protect me peeta it turns out
has never been a danger to me

the thought makes me smile i drop my hands and
hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can
be sure to catch it
so who is there left to be afraid of foxface the boy
tribute from her district is dead shes operating
alone at night and her strategy has been to evade
not attack i dont really think that even if she heard
my voice shed do anything but hope someone else
would kill me
then theres thresh all right hes a distinct threat
but i havent seen him not once since the games
began i think about how foxface grew alarmed when
she heard a sound at the site of the explosion but
she didnt turn to the woods she turned to whatever
lies across from it to that area of the arena that
drops off into i dont know what i feel almost certain
that the person she ran from was thresh and that is
his domain hed never have heard me from there
and even if he did im up too high for someone his
size to reach
so that leaves cato and the girl from district 2 who
are now surely celebrating the new rule theyre the
only ones left who benefit from it besides peeta and
myself do i run from them now on the chance they
heard me call peetas namenoi think let them
come let them come with their nightvision glasses
and their heavy branchbreaking bodies
right into the range of my arrows but i know they
wont if they didnt come in daylight to my fire they
wont risk what could be another trap at night when
they come it will be on their own terms not because
ive let them know my whereabouts

stay put and get some sleep katnissi instruct
myself although i wish i could start tracking peeta
now tomorrow youll find him
i do sleep but in the morning im extra cautious
thinking that while the careers might hesitate to
attack me in a tree theyre completely capable of
setting an ambush for me i make sure to fully
prepare myself for the day — eating a big breakfast
securing my pack readying my weapons — before i
descend but all seems peaceful and undisturbed on
the ground
today 111 have to be scrupulously careful the
careers will know im trying to locate peeta they may
well want to wait until i do before they move in if hes
as badly wounded as cato thinks id be in the
position of having to defend us both without any
assistance but if hes that incapacitated how has he
managed to stay alive and how on earth will i find
him
i try to think of anything peeta ever said that might
give me an indication as to where hes hiding out but
nothing rings a bell so i go back to the last moment i
saw him sparkling in the sunlight yelling at me to
run then cato appeared his sword drawn and after
i was gone he wounded peeta but how did peeta get
away maybe hed held out better against the tracker
j acker poison than cato
maybe that was the variable that allowed him to
escape but hed been stung too so how far could he
have gotten stabbed and filled with venom and how
has he stayed alive all these days since if the wound
and the stingers havent killed him surely thirst
would have taken him by now

and thats when i get my first clue to his
whereabouts he couldnt have survived without
water i know that from my first few days here he
must be hidden somewhere near a source theres the
lake but i find that an unlikely option since its so
close to the careers base camp a few springfed
pools but youd really be a sitting duck at one of
those and the stream the one that leads from the
camp rue and i made all the way down near the lake
and beyond if he stuck to the stream he could
change his location and always be near water he
could walk in the current and erase any tracks he
might even be able to get a fish or two
well its a place to start anyway
to confuse my enemies minds i start a fire with
plenty of green wood even if they think its a ruse i
hope theyll decide im hidden somewhere near it
while in reality ill be tracking peeta
the sun burns off the morning haze almost
immediately and i can tell the day will be hotter than
usual the waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet
as i head downstream im tempted to call out peetas
name as i go but decide against it i will have to find
him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to
find me but hell know 111 be looking right he wont
have so low of an opinion of me as to think id ignore
the new rule and keep to myself would he hes very
hard to predict which might be interesting under
different circumstances but at the moment only
provides an extra obstacle
it doesnt take long to reach the spot where i peeled
off to go the careers camp theres been no sign of
peeta but this doesnt surprise me ive been up and
down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker
incident if he were nearby surely id have had some

suspicion of it the stream begins to curve to the left
into a part of the woods thats new to me muddy
banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large
rocks that increase in size until i begin to feel
somewhat trapped it would be no small matter to
escape the stream now fighting off cato or thresh as
i climbed over this rocky terrain in fact ive just
about decided im on the wrong track entirely that a
wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to
and from this water source when i see the bloody
streak going down the curve of a boulder its long
dried now but the smeary lines running side to side
suggest someone — who perhaps was not fully in
control of his mental faculties — tried to wipe it away
hugging the rocks i move slowly in the direction of
the blood searching for him i find a few more
bloodstains one with a few threads of fabric glued to
it but no sign of life i break down and say his name
in a hushed voice peeta peeta then a mockingjay
lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones
so i stop i give up and climb back down to the stream
thinking he must have moved on somewhere farther
down
my foot has just broken the surface of the water when
i hear a voice
you here to finish me off sweetheart
i whip around its come from the left so i cant pick
it up very well and the voice was hoarse and weak
still it must have been peeta who else in the arena
would call me sweetheart my eyes peruse the bank
but theres nothing just mud the plants the base of
the rocks
peeta i whisper where are you theres no
answer could i just have imagined it no im certain

it was real and very close at hand too peeta i
creep along the bank
well dont step on me
i jump back his voice was right under my feet still
theres nothing then his eyes open unmistakably
blue in the brown mud and green leaves i gasp and
am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs
its the final word in camouflage forget chucking
weights around peeta should have gone into his
private session with the gamemakers and painted
himself into a tree or a boulder or a muddy bank
full of weeds
close your eyes again i order he does and his
mouth too and completely disappears most of what
i judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud
and plants his face and arms are so artfully
disguised as to be invisible i kneel beside him i
guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off
peeta smiles yes frosting the final defense of the
dying
youre not going to die i tell him firmly says who
his voice is so ragged says me were on the same
team now you know i tell him
his eyes open so i heard nice of you to find whats
left of me
i pull out my water bottle and give him a drink did
cato cut you i ask
left leg up high he answers

lets get you in the stream wash you off so i can see
what kind of wounds youve got i say
lean down a minute first he says need to tell you
something i lean over and put my good ear to his
lips which tickle as he whispers remember were
madly in love so its all right to kiss me anytime you
feel like it
i jerk my head back but end up laughing thanks 111
keep it in mind at least hes still able to joke
around but when i start to help him to the stream
all the levity disappears its only two feet away how
hard can it be very hard when i realize hes unable
to move an inch on his own hes so weak that the
best he can do is not to resist i try to drag him but
despite the fact that i know hes doing all he can to
keep quiet sharp cries of pain escape him the mud
and plants seem to have imprisoned him and i finally
have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their
clutches hes still two feet from the water lying
there teeth gritted tears cutting trails in the dirt on
his face
look peeta im going to roll you into the stream its
very shallow here okay i say
excellent he says
i crouch down beside him no matter what happens i
tell myself dont stop until hes in the water on
three i say one two three i can only manage one
full roll before i have to stop because of the horrible
sound hes making now hes on the edge of the
stream maybe this is better anyway
okay change of plans im not going to put you all
the way in i tell him besides if i get him in who
knows if id ever be able to get him out

no more rolling he asks
thats all done lets get you cleaned up keep an eye
on the woods for me okay i say its hard to know
where to start he so caked with mud and matted
leaves i cant even see his clothes if hes wearing
clothes the thought makes me hesitate a moment
but then i plunge in naked bodies are no big deal in
the arena right
ive got two water bottles and rues water skin i prop
them against rocks in the stream so that two are
always filling while i pour the third over peetas body
it takes a while but i finally get rid of enough mud to
find his clothes i gently unzip his jacket unbutton
his shirt and ease them off him his undershirt is so
plastered into his wounds i have to cut it away with
my knife and drench him again to work it loose hes
badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and
four tracker j acker stings if you count the one under
his ear but i feel a bit better this much i can fix i
decide to take care of his upper body first to alleviate
some pain before i tackle whatever damage cato did
to his leg
since treating his wounds seems pointless when hes
lying in whats become a mud puddle i manage to
prop him up against a boulder he sits there
uncomplaining while i wash away all the traces of
dirt from his hair and skin his flesh is very pale in
the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and
stocky i have to dig the stingers out of his tracker
jacker lumps which causes him to wince but the
minute i apply the leaves he sighs in relief while he
dries in the sun i wash his filthy shirt and jacket and
spread them over boulders then i apply the burn
cream to his chest this is when i notice how hot his
skin is becoming the layer of mud and the bottles of
water have disguised the fact that hes burning with

fever i dig through the firstaid kit i got from the boy
from district 1 and find pills that reduce your
temperature my mother actually breaks down and
buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail
swallow these i tell him and he obediently takes
the medicine you must be hungry
not really its funny i havent been hungry for
days says peeta in fact when i offer him groosling
he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away thats
when i know how sick he is
peeta we need to get some food in you i insist
itll just come right back up he says the best i can
do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple
thanks im much better really can i sleep now
katniss he asks
soon i promise i need to look at your leg
first trying to be as gentle as i can i remove his
boots his socks and then very slowly inch his pants
off of him i can see the tear catos sword made in the
fabric over his thigh but it in no way prepares me for
what lies underneath the deep inflamed gash oozing
both blood and pus the swelling of the leg and worst
of all the smell of festering flesh
i want to run away disappear into the woods like i
did that day they brought the burn victim to our
house go and hunt while my mother and prim
attend to what i have neither the skill nor the courage
to face but theres no one here but me i try to
capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes
when handling particularly bad cases
pretty awful huh says peeta hes watching me
closely

soso i shrug like its no big deal you should see
some of the people they bring my mother from the
mines i refrain from saying how i usually clear out
of the house whenever shes treating anything worse
than a cold come to think of it i dont even much
like to be around coughing first thing is to clean it
well
ive left on peetas undershorts because theyre not in
bad shape and i dont want to pull them over the
swollen thigh and all right maybe the idea of him
being naked makes me uncomfortable thats another
thing about my mother and prim nakedness has no
effect on them gives them no cause for
embarrassment ironically at this point in the
games my little sister would be of far more use to
peeta than i am i scoot my square of plastic under
him so i can wash down the rest of him with each
bottle i pour over him the worse the wound looks
the rest of his lower body has fared pretty well just
one tracker j acker sting and a few small burns that i
treat quickly but the gash on his leg  what on earth
can i do for that
why dont we give it some air and then  i trail off
and then youll patch it up says peeta he looks
almost sorry for me as if he knows how lost i am
thats right i say in the meantime you eat
these i put a few dried pear halves in his hand and
go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes
when theyre flattened out and drying i examine the
contents of the firstaid kit its pretty basic stuff
bandages fever pills medicine to calm stomachs
nothing of the caliber ill need to treat peeta
were going to have to experiment some i admit i
know the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection so i

start with those within minutes of pressing the
handful of chewedup green stuff into the wound pus
begins running down the side of his leg i tell myself
this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek
hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a
reappearance
katniss peeta says i meet his eyes knowing my
face must be some shade of green he mouths the
words how about that kiss
i burst out laughing because the whole thing is so
revolting i cant stand it
something wrong he asks a little too innocently
i  im no good at this im not my mother ive no
idea what im doing and i hate pus i say euh i
allow myself to let out a groan as i rinse away the first
round of leaves and apply the second euuuh
how do you hunt he asks
trust me killing things is much easier than this i
say although for all i know i am killing you
can you speed it up a little he asks
no shut up and eat your pears i say
after three applications and what seems like a bucket
of pus the wound does look better now that the
swelling has gone down i can see how deep catos
sword cut right down to the bone
what next dr everdeen he asks
maybe 111 put some of the burn ointment on it i
think it helps with infection anyway and wrap it up

i say i do and the whole thing seems a lot more
manageable covered in clean white cotton although
against the sterile bandage the hem of his
undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion i
pull out rues backpack here cover yourself with
this and 111 wash your shorts
oh i dont care if you see me says peeta
youre just like the rest of my family i say i care
all right i turn my back and look at the stream until
the undershorts splash into the current he must be
feeling a bit better if he can throw
you know youre kind of squeamish for such a lethal
person says peeta as i beat the shorts clean between
two rocks i wish id let you give haymitch a shower
after all
i wrinkle my nose at the memory whats he sent you
so far
not a thing says peeta then theres a pause as it
hits him why did you get something
burn medicine i say almost sheepishly oh and
some bread
i always knew you were his favorite says peeta
please he cant stand being in the same room with
me i say
because youre just alike mutters peeta i ignore it
though because this really isnt the time for me to be
insulting haymitch which is my first impulse

i let peeta doze off while his clothes dry out but by
late afternoon i dont dare wait any longer i gently
shake his shoulder peeta weve got to go now
go he seems confused go where
away from here downstream maybe somewhere we
can hide you until youre stronger i say i help him
dress leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the
water and pull him upright his face drains of color
the moment he puts weight on his leg come on you
can do this
but he cant not for long anyway we make it about
fifty yards downstream with him propped up by my
shoulder and i can tell hes going to black out i sit
him on the bank push his head between his knees
and pat his back awkwardly as i survey the area of
course id love to get him up in a tree but thats not
going to happen it could be worse though some of
the rocks form small cavelike structures i set my
sights on one about twenty yards above the stream
when peetas able to stand i halfguide halfcarry
him up to the cave really id like to look around for
a better place but this one will have to do because
my ally is shot paper white panting and even
though its only just cooling off hes shivering
i cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine
needles unroll my sleeping bag and tuck him into it
i get a couple of pills and some water into him when
hes not noticing but he refuses to eat even the fruit
then he just lies there his eyes trained on my face as
i build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the
mouth of the cave the result is unsatisfactory an
animal might not question it but a human would see
hands had manufactured it quickly enough i tear it
down in frustration

katniss he says i go over to him and brush the
hair back from his eyes thanks for finding me
you would have found me if you could i say his
foreheads burning up like the medicines having no
effect at all suddenly out of nowhere im scared hes
going to die
yes look if i dont make it back —  he begins
dont talk like that i didnt drain all that pus for
nothing i say
i know but just in case i dont —  he tries to
continue
no peeta i dont even want to discuss it i say
placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him
but i —  he insists
impulsively i lean forward and kiss him stopping his
words this is probably overdue anyway since hes
right we are supposed to be madly in love its the
first time ive ever kissed a boy which should make
some sort of impression i guess but all i can register
is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever i
break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up
around him youre not going to die i forbid it all
right
all right he whispers
i step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute
floats down from the sky my fingers quickly undo the
tie hoping for some real medicine to treat peetas leg
instead i find a pot of hot broth

haymitch couldnt be sending me a clearer message
one kiss equals one pot of broth i can almost hear
his snarl youre supposed to be in love sweetheart
the boys dying give me something i can work with
and hes right if i want to keep peeta alive ive got to
give the audience something more to care about star
crossed lovers desperate to get home together two
hearts beating as one romance
never having been in love this is going to be a real
trick i think of my parents the way my father never
failed to bring her gifts from the woods the way my
mothers face would light up at the sound of his boots
at the door the way she almost stopped living when
he died
peeta i say trying for the special tone that my
mother used only with my father hes dozed off
again but i kiss him awake which seems to startle
him then he smiles as if hed be happy to lie there
gazing at me forever hes great at this stuff
i hold up the pot peeta look what haymitch has
sent you

19
getting the broth into peeta takes an hour of coaxing
begging threatening and yes kissing but finally sip
by sip he empties the pot i let him drift off to sleep
then and attend to my own needs wolfing down a
supper of groosling and roots while i watch the daily
report in the sky no new casualties still peeta and i
have given the audience a fairly interesting day
hopefully the gamemakers will allow us a peaceful
night
i automatically look around for a good tree to nest in
before i realize thats over at least for a while i cant
very well leave peeta unguarded on the ground i left
the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the
stream untouched — how could i conceal it — and
were a scant fifty yards downstream i put on my
glasses place my weapons in readiness and settle
down to keep watch
the temperature drops rapidly and soon im chilled to
the bone eventually i give in and slide into the
sleeping bag with peeta its toasty warm and i
snuggle down gratefully until i realize its more than
warm its overly hot because the bag is reflecting
back his fever i check his forehead and find it
burning and dry i dont know what to do leave him
in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the
fever take him out and hope the night air cools him
off i end up just dampening a strip of bandage and
placing it on his forehead it seems weak but im
afraid to do anything too drastic
i spend the night half sitting halflying next to peeta
refreshing the bandage and trying not to dwell on the
fact that by teaming up with him ive made myself far

more vulnerable than when i was alone tethered to
the ground on guard with a very sick person to take
care of but i knew he was injured and still i came
after him im just going to have to trust that
whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one
when the sky turns rosy i notice the sheen of sweat
on peetas lip and discover the fever has broken hes
not back to normal but its come down a few degrees
last night when i was gathering vines i came upon a
bush of rues berries i strip off the fruit and mash it
up in the broth pot with cold water
peetas struggling to get up when i reach the cave i
woke up and you were gone he says i was worried
about you
i have to laugh as i ease him back down you were
worried about me have you taken a look at yourself
lately
i thought cato and clove might have found you
they like to hunt at night he says still serious
clove which one is that i ask
the girl from district two shes still alive righthe
says
yes theres just them and us and thresh and
foxfacei say thats what i nicknamed the girl from
five how do you feel
better than yesterday this is an enormous
improvement over the mud he says clean clothes
and medicine and a sleeping bag  and you
oh right the whole romance thing i reach out to
touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses

it against his lips i remember my father doing this
very thing to my mother and i wonder where peeta
picked it up surely not from his father and the witch
no more kisses for you until youve eaten i say
we get him propped up against the wall and he
obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush i
feed him he refuses the groosling again though
you didnt sleep peeta says
im all right i say but the truth is im exhausted
sleep now ill keep watch ill wake you if anything
happens he says i hesitate katniss you cant stay
up forever
hes got a point there ill have to sleep eventually
and probably better to do it now when he seems
relatively alert and we have daylight on our side all
right i say but just for a few hours then you wake
me
its too warm for the sleeping bag now i smooth it out
on the cave floor and lie down one hand on my
loaded bow in case i have to shoot at a moments
notice peeta sits beside me leaning against the wall
his bad leg stretched out before him his eyes trained
on the world outside go to sleep he says softly his
hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my
forehead unlike the staged kisses and caresses so
far this gesture seems natural and comforting i dont
want him to stop and he doesnt hes still stroking
my hair when i fall asleep
too long i sleep too long i know from the moment i
open my eyes that were into the afternoon peetas
right beside me his position unchanged i sit up

feeling somehow defensive but better rested than ive
been in days
peeta you were supposed to wake me after a couple
of hours i say
for what nothings going on here he says
besides i like watching you sleep you dont scowl
improves your looks a lot
this of course brings on a scowl that makes him
grin thats when i notice how dry his lips are i test
his cheek hot as a coal stove he claims hes been
drinking but the containers still feel full to me i give
him more fever pills and stand over him while he
drinks first one then a second quart of water then i
tend to his minor wounds the burns the stings
which are showing improvement i steel myself and
unwrap the leg
my heart drops into my stomach its worse much
worse theres no more pus in evidence but the
swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is
inflamed then i see the red streaks starting to crawl
up his leg blood poisoning unchecked it will kill
him for sure my chewedup leaves and ointment
wont make a dent in it well need strong anti
infection drugs from the capitol i cant imagine the
cost of such potent medicine if haymitch pooled
every donation from every sponsor would he have
enough i doubt it gifts go up in price the longer the
games continue what buys a full meal on day one
buys a cracker on day twelve and the kind of
medicine peeta needs would have been at a premium
from the beginning
well theres more swelling but the pus is gone i
say in an unsteady voice

i know what blood poisoning is katniss says
peetaeven if my mother isnt a healer
youre just going to have to outlast the others peeta
theyll cure it back at the capitol when we win i say
yes thats a good plan he says but i feel this is
mostly for my benefit
you have to eat keep your strength up im going to
make you soup i say
dont light a fire he says its not worth it
well see i say as i take the pot down to the
stream im struck by how brutally hot it is i swear
the gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the
temperature in the daytime and sending it
plummeting at night the heat of the sunbaked
stones by the stream gives me an idea though maybe
i wont need to light a fire
i settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the
stream and the cave after purifying half a pot of
water i place it in direct sunlight and add several
egg size hot stones to the water im the first to admit
im not much of a cook but since soup mainly
involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting its
one of my better dishes i mince groosling until its
practically mush and mash some of rues roots
fortunately theyve both been roasted already so they
mostly need to be heated up already between the
sunlight and the rocks the waters warm i put in the
meat and roots swap in fresh rocks and go find
something green to spice it up a little before long i
discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some
rocks perfect i chop them very fine and add them to
the pot switch out the rocks again put on the lid
and let the whole thing stew

ive seen very few signs of game around but i dont
feel comfortable leaving peeta alone while i hunt so i
rig half a dozen snares and hope i get lucky i wonder
about the other tributes how theyre managing now
that their main source of food has been blown up at
least three of them cato clove and foxface had
been relying on it probably not thresh though ive
got a feeling he must share some of rues knowledge
on how to feed yourself from the earth are they
fighting each other looking for us maybe one of
them has located us and is just waiting for the right
moment to attack the idea sends me back to the
cave
peetas stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the
shade of the rocks although he brightens a bit when
i come in its clear he feels miserable i put cool
cloths on his head but they warm up almost as soon
as they touch his skin
do you want anything i ask
no he says thank you wait yes tell me a story
a story what about i say im not much for
storytelling its kind of like singing but once in a
while prim wheedles one out of me
something happy tell me about the happiest day
you can remember says peeta
something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation
leaves my mouth a happy story this will require a
lot more effort than the soup i rack my brains for
good memories most of them involve gale and me out
hunting and somehow i dont think these will play
well with either peeta or the audience that leaves
prim

did i ever tell you about how i got prims goat i
ask peeta shakes his head and looks at me
expectantly so i begin but carefully because my
words are going out all over panem and while people
have no doubt put two and two together that i hunt
illegally i dont want to hurt gale or greasy sae or
the butcher or even the peacekeepers back home who
are my customers by publicly announcing theyd
breaking the law too
heres the real story of how i got the money for prims
goat lady it was a friday evening the day before
prims tenth birthday in late may as soon as school
ended gale and i hit the woods because i wanted to
get enough to trade for a present for prim maybe
some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush our
snares had done well enough and the woods were
flush with greens but this was really no more than
our average friday night haul i was disappointed as
we headed back even though gale said wed be sure
to do better tomorrow we were resting a moment by
a stream when we saw him a young buck probably a
yearling by his size his antlers were just growing in
still small and coated in velvet poised to run but
unsure of us unfamiliar with humans beautiful
less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught
him one in the neck the other in the chest gale and
i had shot at the same time the buck tried to run
but stumbled and gales knife slit his throat before
he knew what had happened momentarily id felt a
pang at killing something so fresh and innocent and
then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that
fresh and innocent meat
a deer gale and i have only brought down three in
all the first one a doe that had injured her leg
somehow almost didnt count but we knew from that
experience not to go dragging the carcass into the

hob it had caused chaos with people bidding on
parts and actually trying to hack off pieces
themselves greasy sae had intervened and sent us
with our deer to the butcher but not before itd been
badly damaged hunks of meat taken the hide riddled
with holes although everybody paid up fairly it had
lowered the value of the kill
this time we waited until dark fell and slipped under
a hole in the fence close to the butcher even though
we were known hunters it wouldnt have been good
to go carrying a 150pound deer through the streets
of district 12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the
officials faces
the butcher a short chunky woman named rooba
came to the back door when we knocked you dont
haggle with rooba she gives you one price which
you can take or leave but its a fair price we took her
offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison
steaks we could pick up after the butchering even
with the money divided in two neither gale nor i had
held so much at one time in our lives we decided to
keep it a secret and surprise our families with the
meat and money at the end of the next day
this is where i really got the money for the goat but i
tell peeta i sold an old silver locket of my mothers
that cant hurt anyone then i pick up the story in
the late afternoon of prims birthday
gale and i went to the market on the square so that i
could buy dress materials as i was running my
fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth
something caughtmyeye theres an old man who
keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the
seam i dont know his real name everyone just calls
him the goat man his joints are swollen and twisted
in painful angles and hes got a hacking cough that

proves he spent years in the mines but hes lucky
somewhere along the way he saved up enough for
these goats and now has something to do in his old
age besides slowly starve to death hes filthy and
impatient but the goats are clean and their milk is
rich if you can afford it
one of the goats a white one with black patches was
lying down in a cart it was easy to see why
something probably a dog had mauled her shoulder
and infection had set in it was bad the goat man
had to hold her up to milk her but i thought i knew
someone who could fix it
gale i whispered i want that goat for prim
owning a nanny goat can change your life in district
12 the animals can live off almost anything the
meadows a perfect feeding place and they can give
four quarts of milk a day to drink to make into
cheese to sell its not even against the law
shes hurt pretty bad said gale we better take a
closer look
we went over and bought a cup of milk to share then
stood over the goat as if idly curious
let her be said the man
just looking said gale
well look fast she goes to the butcher soon hardly
anyone will buy her milk and then they only pay half
price said the man
whats the butcher giving for her i asked

the man shrugged hang around and see i turned
and saw rooba coming across the square toward us
lucky thing you showed up said the goat man
when she arrived girls got her eye on your goat
not if shes spoken for i said carelessly
rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the
goat shes not look at that shoulder bet you half
the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage
what said the goat man we had a deal
we had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks
not that thing sell her to the girl if shes stupid
enough to take her said rooba as she marched off
i caught her wink
the goat man was mad but he still wanted that goal
off his hands it took us half an hour to agree on the
price quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand
out opinions it was an excellent deal if the goat lived
id been robbed if she died people took sides in the
argument but i took the goat
gale offered to carry her i think he wanted to see the
look on prims face as much as i did in a moment of
complete giddiness i bought a pink ribbon and tied it
around her neck then we hurried back to my house
you should have seen prims reaction when we
walked in with that goat remember this is a girl who
wept to save that awful old cat buttercup she was
so excited she started crying and laughing all at once
my mother was less sure seeing the injury but the
pair of them went to work on it grinding up herbs
and coaxing brews down the animals throat

they sound like you says peeta i had almost
forgotten he was there
oh no peeta they work magic that thing couldnt
have died if it tried i say but then i bite my tongue
realizing what that must sound like to peeta who is
dying in my incompetent hands
dont worry im not trying he jokes finish the
story
well thats it only i remember that night prim
insisted on sleeping with lady on a blanket next to
the fire and just before they drifted off the goat
licked her cheek like it was giving her a good night
kiss or something i say it was already mad about
her
was it still wearing the pink ribbon he asks
i think so i say why
im just trying to get a picture he says thoughtfully
i can see why that day made you happy
well i knew that goat would be a little gold mine 1
say
yes of course i was referring to that not the lasting
joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her
place in the reaping says peeta drily
the goat has paid for itself several times over i say
in a superior tone
well it wouldnt dare do anything else after you
saved its life says peeta i intend to do the same
thing

really what did you cost me again i ask
a lot of trouble dont worry youll get it all backhe
says
youre not making sense i say i test his forehead
the levers going nowhere but up youre a little
cooler though
the sound of the trumpets startles me im on my feet
and at the mouth of the cave in a flash not wanting
to miss a syllable its my new best friend claudius
templesmith and as i expected hes inviting us to a
feast well were not that hungry and i actually wave
his offer away in indifference when he says now hold
on some of you may already be declining my
invitation but this is no ordinary feast each of you
needs something desperately
i do need something desperately something to heal
peetas leg
each of you will find that something in a backpack
marked with your district number at the cornucopia
at dawn think hard about refusing to show up for
some of you this will be your last chance says
claudius
theres nothing else just his words hanging in the
air i jump as peeta grips my shoulder from behind
no he says youre not risking your life for me
who said i was i say
so youre not going he asks
of course im not going give me some credit do
you think im running straight into some freeforall
against cato and clove and thresh dont be stupid

i say helping him back to bed ill let them fight it
out well see whos in the sky tomorrow night and
work out a plan from there
youre such a bad liar katniss i dont know how
youve survived this long he begins to mimic me i
knew that goat would be a little gold mine youre a
little cooler though of course im not going he
shakes his head never gamble at cards youll lose
your last coin he says
anger flushes my face all right i am going and you
cant stop me
i can follow you at least partway i may not make it
to the cornucopia but if im yelling your name i bet
someone can find me and then ill be dead for sure
he says
you wont get a hundred yards from here on that
leg i say
then 111 drag myself says peeta you go and im
going too
hes just stubborn enough and maybe just strong
enough to do it come howling after me in the woods
even if a tribute doesnt find him something else
might he cant defend himself id probably have to
wall him up in the cave just to go myself and who
knows what the exertion will do to him
what am i supposed to do sit here and watch you
diei say he must know thats not an option that
the audience would hate me and frankly i would
hate myself too if i didnt even try
i wont die i promise if you promise not to go he
says

were at something of a stalemate i know i cant
argue him out of this one so i dont try i pretend
reluctantly to go along then you have to do what i
say drink your water wake me when i tell you and
eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it
is i snap at him
agreed is it ready he asks
wait here i say the airs gone cold even though the
suns still up im right about the gamemakers
messing with the temperature i wonder if the thing
someone needs desperately is a good blanket the
soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot and
actually doesnt taste too bad
peeta eats without complaint even scraping out the
pot to show his enthusiasm he rambles on about
how delicious it is which should be encouraging if
you dont know what fever does to people hes like
listening to haymitch before the alcohol has soaked
him into incoherence i give him another dose of fever
medicine before he goes off his head completely
as i go down to the stream to wash up all i can think
is that hes going to die if i dont get to that feast ill
keep him going for a day or two and then the
infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs
and hell be gone and 111 be here all alone again
waiting for the others
im so lost in thought that i almost miss the
parachute even though it floats right by me then i
spring after it yanking it from the water tearing off
the silver fabric to retrieve the vial haymitch has
done it hes gotten the medicine — i dont know how
persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their
jewels — and i can save peeta its such a tiny vial
though it must be very strong to cure someone as ill

as peeta a ripple of doubt runs through me i uncork
the vial and take a deep sniff my spirits fall at the
sickly sweet scent just to be sure i place a drop on
the tip of my tongue theres no question its sleep
syrup its a common medicine in district 12 cheap
as medicine goes but very addictive almost
everyones had a dose at one time or another we
have some in a bottle at home my mother gives it to
hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a
bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help
someone in pain get through the night it only takes a
little a vial this size could knock peeta out for a full
day but what good is that im so furious im about
to throw haymitchs last offering into the stream
when it hits me a full day thats more than i need
i mash up a handful of berries so the taste wont be
as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good
measure then i head back up to the cave ive
brought you a treat i found a new patch of berries a
little farther downstream
peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without
hesitation he swallows then frowns slightly theyre
very sweet
yes theyre sugar berries my mother makes jam
from them havent you ever had them before i say
poking the next spoonful in his mouth
no he says almost puzzled but they taste
familiar sugar berries
well you cant get them in the market much they
only grow wild i say another mouthful goes down
just one more to go
theyre sweet as syrup he says taking the last
spoonful syrup his eyes widen as he realizes the

truth i clamp my hand over his mouth and nose
hard forcing him to swallow instead of spit he tries
to make himself vomit the stuff up but its too late
hes already losing consciousness even as he fades
away i can see in his eyes what ive done is
unforgivable
i sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture
of sadness and satisfaction a stray berry stains his
chin and i wipe it away who cant lie peeta i say
even though he cant hear me
it doesnt matter the rest of panem can

in the remaining hours before nightfall i gather rocks
and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave
its a slow and arduous process but after a lot of
sweating and shifting things around im pretty
pleased with my work the cave now appears to be
part of a larger pile of rocks like so many in the
vicinity i can still crawl in to peeta through a small
opening but its undetectable from the out« side
thats good because ill need to share that sleeping
bag again tonight also if i dont make it back from
the feast peeta will be hidden but not entirely
imprisoned although i doubt he can hang on much
longer without medicine if i die at the feast district
12 isnt likely to have a victor
i make a meal out of the smaller bonier fish that
inhabit the stream down here fill every water
container and purify it and clean my weapons ive
nine arrows left in all i debate leaving the knife with
peeta so hell have some protection while im gone
but theres really no point he was right about
camouflage being his final defense but i still might
have use for the knife who knows what 111
encounter
here are some things im fairly certain of that at
least cato clove and thresh will be on hand when
the feast starts im not sure about foxface since
direct confrontation isnt her style or her forte shes
even smaller than i am and unarmed unless shes
picked up some weapons recently shell probably be
hanging somewhere nearby seeing what she can
scavenge but the other three  im going to have my
hands full my ability to kill at a distance is my
greatest asset but i know 111 have to go right into the

thick of things to get that backpack the one with the
number 12 on it that claudius templesmith
mentioned
i watch the sky hoping for one less opponent at
dawn but nobody appears tonight tomorrow there
will be faces up there feasts always result in
fatalities
i crawl into the cave secure my glasses and curl up
next to peeta luckily i had that good long sleep
today i have to stay awake i dont really think
anyone will attack our cave tonight but i cant risk
missing the dawn
so cold so bitterly cold tonight as if the
gamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air
across the arena which may be exactly what theyve
done i lay next to peeta in the bag trying to absorb
every bit of his fever heat its strange to be so
physically close to someone whos so distant peeta
might as well be back in the capitol or in district 12
or on the moon right now hed be no harder to reach
ive never felt lonelier since the games began
just accept it will be a bad night i tell myself i try not
to but i cant help thinking of my mother and prim
wondering if theyll sleep a wink tonight at this late
stage in the games with an important event like the
feast school will probably be canceled my family can
either watch on that staticfilled old clunker of a
television at home or join the crowds in the square to
watch on the big clear screens theyll have privacy
at home but support in the square people will give
them a kind word a bit of food if they can spare it i
wonder if the baker has sought them out especially
now that peeta and i are a team and made good on
his promise to keep my sisters belly full

spirits must be running high in district 12 we so
rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the
games surely people are excited about peeta and
me especially now that were together if i close my
eyes i can imagine their shouts at the screens urging
us on i see their faces — greasy sac and madge and
even the peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for
us
and gale i know him he wont be shouting and
cheering but hell be watching every moment every
twist and turn and willing me to come home i
wonder if hes hoping that peeta makes it as well
gales not my boyfriend but would he be if i opened
that door he talked about us running away together
was that just a practical calculation of our chances of
survival away from the district or something more
i wonder what he makes of all this kissing
through a crack in the rocks i watch the moon cross
the sky at what i judge to be about three hours
before dawn i begin final preparations im careful to
leave peeta with water and the medical kit right
beside him nothing else will be of much use if i dont
return and even these would only prolong his life a
short time after some debate i strip him of his jacket
and zip it on over my own he doesnt need it not
now in the sleeping bag with his fever and during the
day if im not there to remove it hell be roasting in
it my hands are already stiff from cold so i take
rues spare pair of socks cut holes for my fingers and
thumbs and pull them on it helps anyway i fill her
small pack with some food a water bottle and
bandages tuck the knife in my belt get my bow and
arrows im about to leave when i remember the
importance of sustaining the starcrossed lover
routine and i lean over and give peeta a long
lingering kiss i imagine the teary sighs emanating

from the capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of
my own then i squeeze through the opening in the
rocks out into the night
my breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air
its as cold as a november night at home one where
ive slipped into the woods lantern in hand to join
gale at some prearranged place where well sit
bundled together sipping herb tea from metal flasks
wrapped in quilting hoping game will pass our way
as the morning comes on oh gale i think if only
you had my back now
i move as fast as i dare the glasses are quite
remarkable but i still sorely miss having the use of
my left ear i dont know what the explosion did but it
damaged something deep and irreparable never
mind if i get home 111 be so stinking rich 111 be able
to pay someone to do my hearing
the woods always look different at night even with
the glasses everything has an unfamiliar slant to it
as if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had
gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions
of themselves to take their places i dont try anything
tricky like taking a new route i make my way back
up the stream and follow the same path back to rues
hiding place near the lake along the way i see no
sign of another tribute not a puff of breath not a
quiver of a branch either im the first to arrive or the
others positioned themselves last night theres still
more than an hour maybe two when i wriggle into
the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to
flow
i chew a few mint leaves my stomach isnt up for
much more thank goodness i have peetas jacket as
well as my own if not id be forced to move around to
stay warm the sky turns a misty morning gray and

still theres no sign of the other tributes its not
surprising really everyone has distinguished
themselves either by strength or deadliness or
cunning do they suppose i wonder that i have peeta
with me i doubt foxface and thresh even know he
was wounded all the better if they think hes covering
me when i go in for the backpack
but where is it the arena has lightened enough for
me to remove my glasses i can hear the morning
birds singing isnt it time for a second im
panicked that im at the wrong location but no im
certain i remember claudius templesmith specifying
the cornucopia and there it is and here i am so
wheres my feast
just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold
cornucopia theres a disturbance on the plain the
ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and
a round table with a snowy white cloth rises into the
arena on the table sit four backpacks two large
black ones with the numbers 2and 11 a mediumsize
green one with the number 5 and a tiny orange one
— really i could carry it around my wrist — that must
be marked with a 12
the table has just clicked into place when a figure
darts out of the cornucopia snags the green
backpack and speeds off foxface leave it to her to
come up with such a clever and risky idea the rest of
us are still poised around the plain sizing up the
situation and shes got hers shes got us trapped
too because no one wants to chase her down not
while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table
foxface must have purposefully left the other packs
alone knowing that to steal one without her number
would definitely bring on a pursuer that should have
been my strategy by the lime ive worked through the
emotions of surprise admiration anger jealousy and

frustration im watching that reddish mane of hair
disappear into the trees well out of shooting range
huh im always dreading the others but maybe
foxface is the real opponent here
shes cost me time too because by now its clear that
i must get to the table next anyone who beats me to
it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone without
hesitation i sprint for the table i can sense the
emergence of danger before i see it fortunately the
first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so i can
hear it and im able to deflect it with my bow i turn
drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow
straight at cloves heart she turns just enough to
avoid a fatal hit but the point punctures her upper
left arm unfortunately she throws with her right
but its enough to slow her down a few moments
having to pull the arrow from her arm take in the
severity of the wound i keep moving positioning the
next arrow automatically as only someone who has
hunted for years can do
im at the table now my fingers closing over the tiny
orange backpack my hand slips between the straps
and i yank it up on my arm its really too small to fit
on any other part of my anatomy and im turning to
fire again when the second knife catches me in the
forehead it slices above my right eyebrow opening a
gash that sends a gush running down my face
blinding my eye filling my mouth with the sharp
metallic taste of my own blood i stagger backward
but still manage to send my readied arrow in the
general direction of my assailant i know as it leaves
my hands it will miss and then clove slams into me
knocking me flat on my back pinning my shoulders
to the ground with her knees
this is it i think and hope for prims sake it will be
fast but clove means to savor the moment even

feels she has time no doubt cato is somewhere
nearby guarding her waiting for thresh and possibly
peeta
wheres your boyfriend district twelve still
hanging on she asks
well as long as were talking im alive hes out there
now hunting cato i snarl at her then i scream at
the top of my lungs peeta
clove jams her fist into my windpipe very effectively
cutting off my voice but her heads whipping from
side to side and i know for a moment shes at least
considering im telling the truth since no peeta
appears to save me she turns back to me
liar she says with a grin hes nearly dead cato
knows where he cut him youve probably got him
strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his
heart going whats in the pretty little backpack that
medicine for lover boy too bad hell never get it
clove opens her jacket its lined with an impressive
array of knives she carefully selects an almost
dainty looking number with a cruel curved blade i
promised cato if he let me have you id give the
audience a good show
im struggling now in an effort to unseat her but its
no use shes too heavy and her lock on me too tight
forget it district twelve were going to kill you
just like we did your pathetic little ally    what was
her name the one who hopped around in the trees
rue well first rue then you and then i think well
just let nature take care of lover boy how does that
sound clove asks now where to start

she carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound
with her jacket sleeve for a moment she surveys my
face tilting it from side to side as if its a block of
wood and shes deciding exactly what pattern to carve
on it i attempt to bite her hand but she grabs the
hair on the top of my head forcing me back to the
ground i think  she almost purrs i think well
start with your mouth i clamp my teeth together as
she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip
of the blade
i wont close my eyes the comment about rue has
filled me with fury enough fury i think to die with
some dignity as my last act of defiance i will stare
her down as long as i can see which will probably not
be an extended period of time but i will stare her
down i will not cry out i will die in my own small
way undefeated
yes i dont think youll have much use for your lips
anymore want to blow lover boy one last kiss she
asks i work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and
spit it in her face she flushes with rage all right
then lets get started
i brace myself for the agony thats sure to follow but
as i feel the tip open the first cut at my lip some great
form yanks clove from my body and then shes
screaming im too stunned at first too unable to
process what has happened has peeta somehow
come to my rescue have the gamemakers sent in
some wild animal to add to the fun has a hovercraft
inexplicably plucked her into the air
but when i push myself up on my numb arms i see
its none of the above clove is dangling a foot off the
ground imprisoned in threshs arms i let out a gasp
seeing him like that towering over me holding clove
like a rag doll i remember him as big but he seems

more massive more powerful than i even recall if
anything he seems to have gained weight in the
arena he flips clove around and flings her onto the
ground
when he shouts i jump never having heard him
speak above a mutter whatd you do to that little
girl you kill her
clove is scrambling backward on all fours like a
frantic insect too shocked to even call for cato no
no it wasnt me
you said her name i heard you you kill her
another thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his
features you cut her up like you were going to cut
up this girl here
no no i —  clove sees the stone about the size of a
small loaf of bread in threshs hand and loses it
cato she screeches cato
clove i hear catos answer but hes too far away i
can tell that much to do her any good what was he
doing trying to get foxface or peeta or had he been
lying in wait for thresh and just badly misjudged his
location
thresh brings the rock down hard against cloves
temple its not bleeding but i can see the dent in her
skull and i know that shes a goner theres still life in
her now though in the rapid rise and fall of her
chest the low moan escaping her lips
when thresh whirls around on me the rock raised i
know its no good to run and my bow is empty the
last loaded arrow having gone in cloves direction im
trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes
whatd she mean about rue being your ally

i — i — we teamed up blew up the supplies i tried
to save her i did but he got there first district one
i say maybe if he knows i helped rue he wont
choose some slow sadistic end for me
and you killed him he demands
yes i killed him and buried her in flowers i
say and i sang her to sleep
tears spring in my eyes the tension the fight goes
out of me at the memory and im overwhelmed by
rue and the pain in my head and my fear of thresh
and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away
to sleep thresh says gruffly
to death i sang until she died i say your
district they sent me bread my hand reaches up
but not for an arrow that i know 111 never reach just
to wipe my nose do it fast okay thresh
conflicting emotions cross threshs face he lowers
the rock and points at me almost accusingly just
this one time i let you go for the little girl you and
me were even then no more owed you
understand
i nod because i do understand about owing about
hating it i understand that if thresh wins hell have
to go back and face a district that has already broken
all the rules to thank me and he is breaking the rules
to thank me too and i understand that for the
moment thresh is not going to smash in my skull
clove catos voice is much nearer now i can tell by
the pain in it that he sees her on the ground
you better run now fire girl says thresh

i dont need to be told twice i flip over and my feet dip
into the hardpacked earth as i run away from thresh
and clove and the sound of catos voice only when i
reach the woods do i turn back for an instant thresh
and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge
of the plain into the area ive never seen cato kneels
beside clove spear in hand begging her to stay with
him in a moment he will realize its futile she cant
be saved i crash into the trees repeatedly swiping
away the blood thats pouring into my eye fleeing like
the wild wounded creature i am after a few minutes
i hear the cannon and i know that clove has died
that cato will be on one of our trails either threshs
or mine im seized with terror weak from my head
wound shaking i load an arrow but cato can throw
that spear almost as far as i can shoot
only one thing calms me down thresh has catos
backpack containing the thing he needs desperately
if i had to bet cato headed out after thresh not me
still i dont slow down when i reach the water i
plunge right in boots still on and flounder
downstream i pull off rues socks that ive been
using for gloves and press them into my forehead
trying to staunch the flow of blood but theyre soaked
in minutes
somehow i make it back to the cave i squeeze
through the rocks in the dappled light i pull the
little orange backpack from my arm cut open the
clasp and dump the contents on the ground one
slim box containing one hypodermic needle without
hesitating i jam the needle into peetas arm and
slowly press down on the plunger
my hands go to my head and then drop to my lap
slick with blood

the last thing i remember is an exquisitely beautiful
green and silver moth landing on the curve of my
wrist

the sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house
gently pulls me toward consciousness i fight to
return to sleep though wrapped in a warm cocoon of
blankets safe at home im vaguely aware that my
head aches possibly i have the flu and this is why im
allowed to stay in bed even though i can tell ive been
asleep a long time my mothers hand strokes my
cheek and i dont push it away as i would in
wakefulness never wanting her to know how much i
crave that gentle touch how much i miss her even
though i still dont trust her then theres a voice the
wrong voice not my mothers and im scared
katniss it says katniss can you hear me
my eyes open and the sense of security vanishes im
not home not with my mother im in a dim chilly
cave my bare feet freezing despite the cover the air
tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood the
haggard pale face of a boy slides into view and after
an initial jolt of alarm i feel better peeta
hey he says good to see your eyes again
how long have i been out i ask
not sure i woke up yesterday evening and you were
lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood he
says i think its stopped finally but i wouldnt sit up
or anything
i gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it
bandaged this simple gesture leaves me weak and
dizzy peeta holds a bottle to my lips and i drink
thirstily

youre better i say
much better whatever you shot into my arm did the
trick he says by this morning almost all the
swelling in my leg was gone
he doesnt seem angry about my tricking him
drugging him and running off to the feast maybe im
just too beatup and 111 hear about it later when im
stronger but for the moment hes all gentleness
did you eat i ask
im sorry to say i gobbled down three pieces of that
groosling before i realized it might have to last a
while dont worry im back on a strict diet he says
no its good you need to eat ill go hunting soon i
say
not too soon all right he says you just let me
take care of you for a while
i dont really seem to have much choice peeta feeds
me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink
plenty of water he rubs some warmth back into my
feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the
sleeping bag back up around my chin
your boots and socks are still damp and the
weathers not helping much he says theres a clap
of thunder and i see lightning electrify the sky
through an opening in the rocks rain drips through
several holes in the ceiling but peeta has built a sort
of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging
the square of plastic into the rock above me
i wonder what brought on this storm i mean whos
the target says peeta

cato and thresh i say without thinking foxface
will be in her den somewhere and clove  she cut
me an then my voice trails off
i know cloves dead i saw it in the sky last night he
says did you kill her
no thresh broke her skull with a rock i say
lucky he didnt catch you too says peeta
the memory of the feast returns fullforce and i feel
sick he did but he let me go then of course i
have to tell him about things ive kept to myself
because he was too sick to ask and i wasnt ready to
relive anyway like the explosion and my ear and
rues dying and the boy from district 1 and the
bread all of which leads to what happened with
thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts
he let you go because he didnt want to owe you
anything asks peeta in disbelief
yes i dont expect you to understand it youve
always had enough but if youd lived in the seam i
wouldnt have to explain i say
and dont try obviously im too dim to get it
its like the bread how i never seem to get over
owing you for that i say
the bread what from when we were kids he
says i think we can let that go i mean you just
brought me back from the dead
but you didnt know me we had never even spoken
besides its the first gift thats always the hardest to
pay back i wouldnt even have been here to do it if

you hadnt helped me then i say why did you
anyway
why you know why peeta says i give my head a
slight painful shake haymitch said you would take
a lot of convincing
haymitch i ask whats he got to do with it
nothing peeta says so cato and thresh huh i
guess its too much to hope that theyll
simultaneously destroy each other
but the thought only upsets me i think we would
like thresh i think hed be our friend back in district
twelve i say
then lets hope cato kills him so we dont have
to says peeta grimly
i dont want cato to kill thresh at all i dont want
anyone else to die but this is absolutely not the kind
of thing that victors go around saying in the arena
despite my best efforts i can feel tears starting to
pool in my eyes
peeta looks at me in concern what is it are you in
a lot of pain
i give him another answer because it is equally true
but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness
instead of a terminal one i want to go home peeta
i say plaintively like a small child
you will i promise he says and bends over to give
me a kiss
i want to go home now i say

tell you what you go back to sleep and dream of
home and you 11 be there for real before you know
itlie says okay
okay i whisper wake me if you need me to keep
watch
im good and rested thanks to you and haymitch
besides who knows how long this will last he says
what does he mean the storm the brief respite ii
brings us the games themselves i dont know but
im ion sad and tired to ask
its evening when peeta wakes me again the rain has
turned to a downpour sending streams of water
through our ceiling where earlier there had been only
drips peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst
one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it
from me i feel a bit better able to sit up without
getting too dizzy and im absolutely famished so is
peeta its clear hes been waiting for me to wake up to
eat and is eager to get started
theres not much left two pieces of groosling a small
mishmash of roots and a handful of dried fruit
should we try and ration it peeta asks
no lets just finish it the grooslings getting old
anyway and the last thing we need is to get sick
offspoilt food i say dividing the food into two equal
piles we tryand eat slowly but were both so hungry
were done in a couple of minutes my stomach is in
no way satisfied tomorrows a hunting day i say
i wont be much help with that peeta says ive
never hunted before

ill kill and you cook i say and you can always
gather
i wish there was some sort of bread bush out
there says peeta
the bread they sent me from district eleven was still
warm i say with a sigh here chew these i hand
him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own
mouth
its hard to even see the projection in the sky but its
clear enough to know there were no more deaths
today so cato and thresh havent had it out yet
where did thresh go i mean whats on the far side
of the circle i ask peeta
a field as far as you can see its full of grasses as
high as my shoulders i dont know maybe some of
them are grain there are patches of different colors
but there are no paths says peeta
i bet some of them are grain i bet thresh knows
which ones too i say did you go in there
no nobody really wanted to track thresh down in
that grass it has a sinister feeling to it every time i
look at that field all i can think of are hidden things
snakes and rabid animals and quicksand peeta
says there could be anything in there
i dont say so but peetas words remind me of the
warnings they give us about not going beyond the
fence in district 121 cant help for a moment
comparing him with gale who would see that field as
a potential source of food as well as a threat thresh
certainly did its not that peetas soft exactly and
hes proved hes not a coward but there are things

you dont question too much i guess when your
home always smells like baking bread whereas gale
questions everything what would peeta think of the
irreverent banter that passes between us as we break
the law each day would it shock him the things we
say about panem gales tirades against the capitol
maybe there is a bread bush in that field i
say maybe thats why thresh looks better fed now
than when we started the games
either that or hes got very generous sponsors says
peeta i wonder what wed have to do to get haymitch
to send us some bread
i raise my eyebrows before i remember he doesnt
know about the message haymitch sent us a couple
of nights ago one kiss equals one pot of broth its
not the sort of thing i can blurt out either to say my
thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that
the romance has been fabricated to play on their
sympathies and that would result in no food at all
somehow believably ive got to get things back on
track something simple to start with i reach out and
take his hand
well he probably used up a lot of resources helping
me knock you out i say mischievously
yeah about that says peeta entwining his fingers
in mine dont try something like that again
or what i ask
or  or  he cant think of anything good just
give me a minute
whats the problem i say with a grin

the problem is were both still alive which only
reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right
thingsays peeta
i did do the right thing i say
no just dont katniss his grip tightens hurting
my hand and theres real anger in his voice dont
die for me you wont be doing me any favors all
right
im startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent
opportunity for getting food so i try to keep up
maybe i did it for myself peeta did you ever think of
that maybe you arent the only one who    who
worries about  what it would be like if
i fumble im not as smooth with words as peeta and
while i was talking the idea of actually losing peeta
hit me again and i realized how much i dont want
him to die and its not about the sponsors and its
not about what will happen back home and its not
just that i dont want to be alone its him i do not
want to lose the boy with the bread
if what katniss he says softly
i wish i could pull the shutters closed blocking out
this moment from the prying eyes of panem even if it
means losing food whatever im feeling its no ones
business but mine
thats exactly the kind of topic haymitch told me to
steer clear of i say evasively although haymitch
never said anything of the kind in fact hes probably
cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during
such an emotionally charged moment but peeta
somehow catches it

then 111 just have to fill in the blanks myself he
says and moves in to me
this is the first kiss that were both fully aware of
neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply
unconscious our lips neither burning with fever or
icy cold this is the first kiss where i actually feel
stirring inside my chest warm and curious this is
the first kiss that makes me want another
but i dont get it well i do get a second kiss but its
just a light one on the tip of my nose because peetas
been distracted i think your wound is bleeding
again come on lie down its bedtime anyway he
says
my socks are dry enough to wear now i make peeta
put his jacket back on the damp cold seems to cut
right down to my bones so he must be half frozen i
insist on taking the first watch too although neither
of us think its likely anyone will come in this
weather but he wont agree unless im in the bag
too and im shivering so hard that its pointless to
object in stark contrast to two nights ago when i felt
peeta was a million miles away im struck by his
immediacy now as we settle in he pulls my head
down to use his arm as a pillow the other rests
protectively over me even when he goes to sleep no
one has held me like this in such a long time since
my father died and i stopped trusting my mother no
one elses arms have made me feel this safe
with the aid of the glasses i lie watching the drips of
water splatter on the cave floor rhythmic and lulling
several times i drift off briefly and then snap awake
guilty and angry with myself after three or four
hours i cant help it i have to rouse peeta because i
cant keep my eyes open he doesnt seem to mind

tomorrow when its dry 111 find us a place so high
in the trees we can both sleep in peace i promise as
i drift off
but tomorrow is no better in terms of weather the
deluge continues as if the gamemakers are intent on
washing us all away the thunders so powerful it
seems to shake the ground peetas considering
heading out anyway to scavenge for food but i tell
him in this storm it would be pointless he wont be
able to see three feet in front of his face and hell only
end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles he
knows im right but the gnawing in our stomachs is
becoming painful
the day drags on turning into evening and theres no
break in the weather haymitch is our only hope but
nothing is forthcoming either from lack of money —
everything will cost an exorbitant amount — or
because hes dissatisfied with our performance
probably the latter id be the first to admit were not
exactly riveting today starving weak from injuries
trying not to reopen wounds were sitting huddled
together wrapped in the sleeping bag yes but mostly
to keep warm the most exciting thing either of us
does is nap
im not really sure how to ramp up the romance the
kiss last night was nice but working up to another
will take some forethought there are girls in the
seam some of the merchant girls too who navigate
these waters so easily but ive never had much time
or use for it anyway just a kiss isnt enough
anymore clearly because if it was wed have gotten
food last night my instincts tell me haymitch isnt
just looking for physical affection he wants
something more personal the sort of stuff he was
trying to get me to tell about myself when we were
practicing for the interview im rotten at it but

peetas not maybe the best approach is to get him
talking
peeta i say lightly you said at the interview youd
had a crush on me forever when did forever start
oh lets see i guess the first day of school we were
five you had on a red plaid dress and your hair  it
was in two braids instead of one my father pointed
you out when we were waiting to line up peeta says
your father why i ask
he said see that little girl i wanted to marry her
mother but she ran off with a coal miner peeta
says
what youre making that up i exclaim
no true story peeta says and i said a coal
miner why did she want a coal miner if she could ve
had you and he said because when he sings
even the birds stop to listen
thats true they do i mean they did i say im
stunned and surprisingly moved thinking of the
baker telling this to peeta it strikes me that my own
reluctance to sing my own dismissal of music might
not really be that i think its a waste of time it might
be because it reminds me too much of my father
so that day in music assembly the teacher asked
who knew the valley song your hand shot right up in
the air she stood you up on a stool and had you sing
it for us and i swear every bird outside the windows
fell silent peeta says
oh please i say laughing

no it happened and right when your song ended i
knew — just like your mother — i was a goner peeta
says then for the next eleven years i tried to work
up the nerve to talk to you
without success i add
without success so in a way my name being drawn
in the reaping was a real piece of luck says peeta
for a moment im almost foolishly happy and then
confusion sweeps over me because were supposed to
be making up this stuff playing at being in love not
actually being in love but peetas story has a ring of
truth to it that part about my father and the birds
and i did sing the first day of school although i dont
remember the song and that red plaid dress    there
was one a handmedown to prim that got washed to
rags after my fathers death
it would explain another thing too why peeta took a
beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day
so if those details are true  could it all be true
you have a  remarkable memory i say haltingly
i remember everything about you says peeta
tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear youre
the one who wasnt paying attention
i am now i say
well i dont have much competition here he says
i want to draw away to close those shutters again
but i know i cant its as if i can hear haymitch
whispering in my ear say it say it

i swallow hard and get the words out you dont have
much competition anywhere and this time its me
who leans in
our lips have just barely touched when the clunk
outside makes us jump my bow comes up the arrow
ready to fly but theres no other sound peeta peers
through the rocks and then gives a whoop before i
can stop him lies out in the rain then handing
something in to me a silver parachute attached to a
basket i rip it open at once and inside theres a feast
— fresh rolls goat cheese apples and best of all a
tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice the
very dish i told caesar flickerman was the most
impressive thing the capitol had to offer
peeta wriggles back inside his face lit up like the sun
i guess haymitch finally got tired of watching us
starve
i guess so i answer
but in my head i can hear haymitch s smug if
slightly exasperated words yes thats what im
looking lot sweetheart

every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew
and cram it handful by handful into my mouth but
peetas voice stops me we better take it slow on that
stew remember the first night on the train the rich
food made me sick and i wasnt even starving then
youre right and i could just inhale the whole
thingi say regretfully but i dont we are quite
sensible we each have a roll half an apple and an
egg size serving of stew and rice i make myself eat
the stew in tiny spoonfuls — they even sent us
silverware and plates — savoring each bite when we
finish i stare longingly at the dish i want more
me too tell you what we wait an hour if it stays
down then we get another serving peeta says
agreed i say its going to be a long hour
maybe not that long says peeta what was that
you were saying just before the food arrived
something about me  no competition  best thing
that ever happened to you
i dont remember that last part i say hoping its too
dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush
oh thats right thats what  was thinking he says
scoot over im freezing
i make room for him in the sleeping bag we lean
back against the cave wall my head on his shoulder
his arms wrapped around me i can feel haymitch
nudging me to keep up the act so since we were

five you never even noticed any other girls i ask
him
no i noticed just about every girl but none of them
made a lasting impression but you he says
im sure that would thrill your parents you liking a
girl from the seam i say
hardly but i couldnt care less anyway if we make
it back you wont be a girl from the seam youll be a
girl from the victors village he says
thats right if we win well each get a house in the
part of town reserved for hunger games victors long
ago when the games began the capitol had built a
dozen fine houses in each district of course in ours
only one is occupied most of the others have never
been lived in at all
a disturbing thought hits me but then our only
neighbor will be haymitch
ah thatll be nice says peeta tightening his arms
around me you and me and haymitch very cozy
picnics birthdays long winter nights around the fire
retelling old hunger games tales
i told you he hates me i say but i cant help
laughing at the image of haymitch becoming my new
pal
only sometimes when hes sober ive never heard
him say one negative thing about you says peeta
hes never sober i protest
thats right who am i thinking of oh i know its
cinna who likes you but thats mainly because you

didnt try to run when he set you on fire says peeta
on the other hand haymitch    well if i were you
id avoid haymitch completely he hates you
i thought you said i was his favorite i say
he hates me more says peeta i dont think people
in general are his sort of thing
i know the audience will enjoy our having fun at
haymitchs expense he has been around so long
hes practically an old friend to some of them and
after his headdive off the stage at the reaping
everybody knows him by this time theyll have
dragged him out of the control room for interviews
about us no telling what sort of lies hes made up
hes at something of a disadvantage because most
mentors have a partner another victor to help them
whereas haymitch has to be ready to go into action at
any moment kind of like me when i was alone in the
arena i wonder how hes holding up with the
drinking the attention and the stress of trying to
keep us alive
its funny haymitch and i dont get along well in
person but maybe peeta is right about us being alike
because he seems able to communicate with me by
the timing of his gifts like how i knew i must be
close to water when he withheld it and how i knew
the sleep syrup just wasnt something to ease peetas
pain and how i know now that i have to play up the
romance he hasnt made much effort to connect with
peeta really perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would
just be a bowl of broth to peeta whereas ill see the
strings attached to it
a thought hits me and im amazed the questions
taken so long to surface maybe its because ive only

recently begun to view haymitch with a degree of
curiosity how do you think he did it
who did what peeta asks
haymitch how do you think he won the games i
say
peeta considers this quite a while before he answers
haymitch is sturdily built but no physical wonder
like cato or thresh hes not particularly handsome
not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on
you and hes so surly its hard to imagine anyone
teaming up with him theres only one way haymitch
could have won and peeta says it just as im reaching
this conclusion myself
he outsmarted the others says peeta
i nod then let the conversation drop but secretly im
wondering if haymitch sobered up long enough to
help peeta and me because he thought we just might
have the wits to survive maybe he wasnt always a
drunk maybe in the beginning he tried to help the
tributes but then it got unbearable it must be hell to
mentor two kids and then watch them die year after
year after year i realize that if i get out of here that
will become my job to mentor the girl from district
12 the idea is so repellent i thrust it from my mind
about half an hour has passed before i decide i have
to eat again peetas too hungry himself to put up an
argument while im dishing up two more small
servings of lamb stew and rice we hear the anthem
begin to play peeta presses his eyes against a crack
in the rocks to watch the sky

there wont be anything to see tonight i say far
more interested in the stew than the sky nothings
happened or we wouldve heard a cannon
katniss peeta says quietly
what should we split another roll too i ask
katniss he repeats but i find myself wanting to
ignore him
im going to split one but 111 save the cheese for
tomorrow i say i see peeta staring at me what
thresh is dead says peeta
he cant be i say
they must have fired the cannon during the thunder
and we missed it says peeta
are you sure i mean its pouring buckets out there
i dont know how you can see anything i say i push
him away from the rocks and squint out into the
dark rainy sky for about ten seconds i catch a
distorted glimpse of threshs picture and then hes
gone just like that
i slump down against the rocks momentarily
forgetting about the task at hand thresh dead i
should be happy right one less tribute to face and
a powerful one too but im not happy all i can think
about is thresh letting me go letting me run because
of rue who died with that spear in her stomach
you all right asks peeta
i give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my
hands hugging them close to my body i have to bury

the real pain because whos going to bet on a tribute
who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents
rue was one thing we were allies she was so young
but no one will understand my sorrow at threshs
murder the word pulls me up short murder
thankfully i didnt say it aloud thats not going to
win me any points in the arena what i do say is its
just  if we didnt win  i wanted thresh to because
he let me go and because of rue
yeah i know says peeta but this means were one
step closer to district twelve he nudges a plate of
foot into my hands eat its still warm
i take a bite of the stew to show i dont really care
but its like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort
to swallow it also means cato will be back hunting
us
and hes got supplies again says peeta
hell be wounded i bet i say
what makes you say that peeta asks
because thresh would have never gone down
without a fight hes so strong i mean he was and
they were in his territory i say
good says peeta the more wounded cato is the
better i wonder how foxface is making out
oh shes fine i say peevishly im still angry she
thought of hiding in the cornucopia and i didnt
probably be easier to catch cato than her
maybe theyh catch each other and we can just go
home says peeta but we better be extra careful
about the watches i dozed off a few times

me too i admit but not tonight
we finish our food in silence and then peeta offers to
take the first watch i burrow down in the sleeping
bag next to him pulling my hood up over my face to
hide it from the cameras i just need a few moments
of privacy where i can let any emotion cross my face
without being seen under the hood i silently say
goodbye to thresh and thank him for my life i
promise to remember him and if i can do something
to help his family and rues if i win then i escape
into sleep comforted by a full belly and the steady
warmth of peeta beside me
when peeta wakes me later the first thing i register is
the smell of goat cheese hes holding out half a roll
spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with
apple slices dont be mad he says i had to eat
again heres your half
oh good i say immediately taking a huge bite the
strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind prim
makes the apples are sweet and crunchy mm
we make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery
he says
bet thats expensive i say
too expensive for my family to eat unless its gone
very stale of course practically everything we eat is
stale says peeta pulling the sleeping bag up around
him in less than a minute hes snoring
huh i always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft
life
and its true peeta has always had enough to eat
but theres something kind of depressing about living

your life on stale bread the hard dry loaves that no
one else wanted one thing about us since i bring
our food home on a daily basis most of it is so fresh
you have to make sure it isnt going to make a run for
it
somewhere during my shift the rain stops not
gradually but all at once the downpour ends and
theres only the residual drippings of water from
branches the rush of the now overflowing stream
below us a full beautiful moon emerges and even
without the glasses i can see outside i cant decide if
the moon is real or merely a projection of the
gamemakers i know it was full shortly before i left
home gale and i watched it rise as we hunted into
the late hours
how long have i been gone im guessing its been
about two weeks in the arena and there was that
week of preparation in the capitol maybe the moon
has completed its cycle for some reason i badly
want it to be my moon the same one i see from the
woods around district 12 that would give me
something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena
where the authenticity of everything is to be doubted
four of us left
for the first time i allow myself to truly think about
the possibility that i might make it home to fame to
wealth to my own house in the victors village my
mother and prim would live there with me no more
fear of hunger a new kind of freedom but then
what what would my life be like on a daily basis
most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of
food take that away and im not really sure who i
am what my identity is the idea scares me some i
think of haymitch with all his money what did his
life become he lives alone no wife or children most

of his waking hours drunk i dont want to end up like
that
but you wont be alone i whisper to myself i have
my mother and prim well for the time being and
then  i dont want to think about then when prim
has grown up my mother passed away i know 111
never marry never risk bringing a child into the
world because if theres one thing being a victor
doesnt guarantee its your childrens safety my kids
names would go right into the reaping balls with
everyone elses and i swear ill never let that happen
the sun eventually rises its light slipping through the
cracks and illuminating peetas face who will he
transform into if we make it home this perplexing
goodnatured boy who can spin out lies so
convincingly the whole of panem believes him to be
hopelessly in love with me and 111 admit it there are
moments when he makes me believe it myself at
least well be friends i think nothing will change the
fact that weve saved each others lives in here and
beyond that he will always be the boy with the bread
good friends any thing beyond that though  and i
feel gales gray eyes watching me watching peeta all
the way from district 12
discomfort causes me to move i scoot over and shake
peetas shoulder his eyes open sleepily and when
they focus on me he pulls me down for a long kiss
were wasting hunting time i say when i finally
break away
i wouldnt call it wasting he says giving a big
stretch as he sits up so do we hunt on empty
stomachs to give us an edge

not us i say we stuff ourselves to give us staying
power
count me in peeta says but i can see hes
surprised when i divide the rest of the stew and rice
and hand a heaping plate to him all this
well earn it back today i say and we both plow
into our plates even cold its one of the best things
ive ever tasted i abandon my fork and scrape up the
last dabs of gravy with my finger i can feel effie
trinket shuddering at my manners
hey effie watch this says peeta he tosses his fork
over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean
with his tongue making loud satisfied sounds then
he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls we
miss you effie
i cover his mouth with my hand but im laughing
stop cato could be right outside our cave
he grabs my hand away what do i care ive got you
to protect me now says peeta pulling me to him
come on i say in exasperation extricating myself
from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss
once were packed up and standing outside our cave
our mood shifts to serious its as though for the last
few days sheltered by the rocks and the rain and
catos preoccupation with thresh we were given a
respite a holiday of sorts now although the day is
sunny and warm we both sense were really back in
the games i hand peeta my knife since whatever
weapons he once had are long gone and he slips it
into his belt my last seven arrows — of the twelve i
sacrificed three in the explosion two at the feast —

rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver i cant afford to
lose any more
hell be hunting us by now says peeta cato isnt
one to wait for his prey to wander by
if hes wounded —  i begin
it wont matter peeta breaks in if he can move
hes coming
with all the rain the stream has overrun its banks by
several feet on either side we stop there to replenish
our water i check the snares i set days ago and come
up empty not surprising with the weather besides i
havent seen many animals or signs of them in this
area
if we want food we better head back up to my old
hunting grounds i say
your call just tell me what you need me to do
peeta says
keep an eye out i say stay on the rocks as much
as possible no sense in leaving him tracks to follow
and listen for both of us its clear at this point that
the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for
good
id walk in the water to cover our tracks completely
but im not sure peetas leg could take the current
although the drugs have erased the infection hes
still pretty weak my forehead hurts along the knife
cut but after three days the bleeding has stopped i
wear a bandage around my head though just in case
physical exertion should bring it back

as we head up alongside the stream we pass the
place where i found peeta camouflaged in the weeds
and mud one good thing between the downpour and
the flooded banks all signs of his hiding place have
been wiped out that means that if need be we can
come back to our cave otherwise i wouldnt risk it
with cato after us
the boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn
to pebbles and then to my relief were back on pine
needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor for
the first time i realize we have a problem navigating
the rocky terrain with a bad leg — well youre
naturally going to make some noise but even on the
smooth bed of needles peeta is loud and i
meanloudloud as if hes stomping his feet or
something i turn and look at him
what he asks
youve got to move more quietly i say forget about
cato youre chasing off every rabbit in a tenmile
radius
really he says sorry i didnt know
so we start up again and hes a tiny bit better but
even with only one working ear hes making me
jump
can you take your boots off i suggest
here he asks in disbelief as if id asked him to
walk barefoot on hot coals or something i have to
remind myself that hes still not used to the woods
that its the scary forbidden place beyond the fences
of district 12 i think of gale with his velvet tread
its eerie how little sound he makes even when the
leaves have fallen and its a challenge to move at all

without chasing off the game i feel certain hes
laughing back home
yes i say patiently i will too that way well both
be quieter like i was making any noise so we both
strip off our boots and socks and while theres some
improvement i could swear hes making an effort to
snap every branch we encounter
needless to say although it takes several hours to
reach my old camp with rue ive shot nothing if the
stream would settle down fish might be an option
but the current is still too strong as we stop to rest
and drink water i try to work out a solution ideally
id dump peeta now with some simple rootgathering
chore and go hunt but then hed be left with only a
knife to defend himself against catos spears and
superior strength so what id really like is to try and
conceal him somewhere safe then go hunt and come
back and collect him but i have a feeling his ego isnt
going to go for that suggestion
katniss he says we need to split up i know im
chasing away the game
only because your legs hurt i say generously
because really you can tell thats only a small part of
the problem
i know he says so why dont you go on show me
some plants to gather and that way well both be
useful
not if cato comes and kills you i tried to say it in a
nice way but it still sounds like i think hes a
weakling
surprisingly he just laughs look i can handle
cato i fought him before didnt i

yeah and that turned out great you ended up dying
in a mud bank thats what i want to say but i cant
he did save my life by taking on cato after all i try
another tactic what if you climbed up in a tree and
acted as a lookout while i hunted i say trying to
make it sound like very important work
what if you show me whats edible around here and
go get us some meat he says mimicking my tone
just dont go far in case you need help
i sigh and show him some roots to dig we do need
food no question one apple two rolls and a blob of
cheese the size of a plum wont last long ill just go a
short distance and hope cato is a long way off
i teach him a bird whistle — not a melody like rues
but a simple twonote whistle — which we can use to
communicate that were all right fortunately hes
good at this leaving him with the pack i head off
i feel like im eleven again tethered not to the safety
of the fence but to peeta allowing myself twenty
maybe thirty yards of hunting space away from him
though the woods come alive with animal sounds
reassured by his periodic whistles i allow myself to
drift farther away and soon have two rabbits and a
fat squirrel to show for it i decide its enough i can
set snares and maybe get some fish with peetas
roots this will be enough for now
as i travel the short distance back i realize we
havent exchanged signals in a while when my
whistle receives no response i run in no time i find
the pack a neat pile of roots beside it the sheet of
plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun
can reach the single layer of berries that covers it
but where is he

peeta i call out in a panic peeta i turn to the
rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through
him fortunately i pull my bow at the last second
and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left he jumps
back flinging a handful of berries into the foliage
my fear comes out as anger what are you doing
youre supposed to be here not running around in
the woods
i found some berries down by the stream he says
clearly confused by my outburst
i whistled why didnt you whistle backisnap at
him
i didnt hear the waters too loud i guess he says
he crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders
thats when i feel that im trembling
i thought cato killed you i almost shout
no im fine peeta wraps his arms around me but i
dont respond katniss
i push away trying to sort out my feelings if two
people agree on a signal they stay in range because
if one of them doesnt answer theyre in trouble all
right
all right he says
all right because thats what happened with rue
and i watched her die i say i turn away from him
go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water
although i still have some in mine but im not ready
to forgive him i notice the food the rolls and apples
are untouched but someones definitely picked away
part of the cheese and you ate without me i really

dont care i just want something else to be mad
about
what no i didnt peeta says
oh and i suppose the apples ate the cheese i say
i dont know what ate the cheese peeta says slowly
and distinctly as if trying not to lose his temper but
it wasnt me ive been down by the stream collecting
berries would you care for some
i would actually but i dont want to relent too soon i
do walk over and look at them ive never seen this
type before no i have but not in the arena these
arent rues berries although they resemble them
nor do they match any i learned about in training i
lean down and scoop up a few rolling them between
my fingers
my fathers voice comes back to me not these
katniss never these theyre nightlock you 11 be dead
before they reach your stomach
just then the cannon fires i whip around expecting
peeta to collapse to the ground but he only raises his
eyebrows the hovercraft appears a hundred yards or
so away whats left of foxfaces emaciated body is
lifted into the air i can see the red glint of her hair in
the sunlight
i should have known the moment i saw the missing
cheese
peeta has me by the arm pushing me toward a
tree climb hell be here in a second well stand a
better chance fighting him from above

i stop him suddenly calm no peeta shes your kill
not catos
what i havent even seen her since the first day he
says how could i have killed her
in answer i hold out the berries

it takes a while to explain the situation to peeta how
foxface stole the food from the supply pile before i
blew it up how she tried to take enough to stay alive
but not enough that anyone would notice it how she
wouldnt question the safely of berries we were
preparing to eat ourselves
i wonder how she found us says peeta my fault i
guess if im as loud as you say
we were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle
but i try to be kind and shes very clever peeta
well she was until you outfoxed her
not on purpose doesnt seem fair somehow i mean
we would have both been dead too if she hadnt
eaten the berries first he checks himself no of
course we wouldnt you recognized them didnt
you
i give a nod we call them nightlock
even the name sounds deadly he says im sorry
katniss i really thought they were the same ones
youd gathered
dont apologize it just means were one step closer to
home right i ask
ill get rid of the rest peeta says he gathers up the
sheet of blue plastic careful to trap the berries inside
and goes to toss them into the woods
wait i cry i find the leather pouch that belonged to
the boy from district 1 and fill it with a few handfuls

of berries from the plastic if they fooled foxface
maybe they can fool cato as well if hes chasing us or
something we can act like we accidentally drop the
pouch and if he eats them —
then hello district twelve says peeta
thats it i say securing the pouch to my belt
hell know where we are now says peeta if he was
anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft hell know
we killed her and come after us
peetas right this could be just the opportunity
catos been waiting for but even if we run now
theres the meat to cook and our fire will be another
sign of our whereabouts lets make a fire right
now i begin to gather branches and brush
are you ready to face him peeta asks
im ready to eat better to cook our food while we
have the chance if he knows were here he knows
but he also knows theres two of us and probably
assumes we were hunting foxface that means youre
recovered and the fire means were not hiding were
inviting him here would you show up i ask
maybe not he says
peetas a whiz with fires coaxing a blaze out of the
damp wood in no time i have the rabbits and
squirrel roasting the roots wrapped in leaves baking
in the coals we take turns gathering greens and
keeping a careful watch for cato but as i anticipated
he doesnt make an appearance
when the foods cooked i pack most of it up leaving
us each a rabbits leg to eat as we walk

i want to move higher into the woods climb a good
tree and make camp for the night but peeta resists
i cant climb like you katniss especially with my leg
and i dont think i could ever fall asleep fifty feet
above the ground
its not safe to stay in the open peeta i say
cant we go back to the cave he asks its near
water and easy to defend
i sigh several more hours of walking — or should i
say crashing — through the woods to reach an area
well just have to leave in the morning to hunt but
peeta doesnt ask for much hes followed my
instructions all day and im sure if things were
reversed he wouldnt make me spend the night in a
tree it dawns on me that i havent been very nice to
peeta today nagging him about how loud he was
screaming at him over disappearing the playful
romance we had sustained in the cave has
disappeared out in the open under the hot sun with
the threat of cato looming over us haymitch has
probably just about had it with me and as for the
audience
i reach up and give him a kiss sure lets go back to
the cave
he looks pleased and relieved well that was easy
i work my arrow out of the oak careful not to damage
the shaft these arrows are food safety and life itself
now
we toss a bunch more wood on the fire it should be
sending off smoke for a few more hours although i
doubt cato assumes anything at this point when we
reach the stream i see the water has dropped

considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace so i
suggest we walk back in it peetas happy to oblige
and since hes a lot quieter in water than on land its
a doubly good idea its a long walk back to the cave
though even going downward even with the rabbit to
give us a boost were both exhausted by our hike
today and still way too underfed i keep my bow
loaded both for cato and any fish i might see but the
stream seems strangely empty of creatures
by the time we reach our destination our feet are
dragging and the sun sits low on the horizon we fill
up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our
den its not much but out here in the wilderness its
the closest thing we have to a home it will be warmer
than a tree too because it provides some shelter
from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from
the west i set a good dinner out but halfway through
peeta begins to nod off after days of inactivity the
hunt has taken its toll i order him into the sleeping
bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he
wakes he drops off immediately i pull the sleeping
bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead not for the
audience but for me because im so grateful that
hes still here not dead by the stream as id thought
so glad that i dont have to face cato alone
brutal bloody cato who can snap a neck with a twist
of his arm who had the power to overcome thresh
who has had it out for me since the beginning he
probably has had a special hatred for me ever since i
outscored him in training a boy like peeta would
simply shrug that off but i have a feeling it drove
cato to distraction which is not that hard i think of
his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown
up the others were upset of course but he was
completely unhinged i wonder now if cato might not
be entirely sane

the sky lights up with the seal and i watch foxface
shine in the sky and then disappear from the world
forever he hasnt said it but i dont think peeta felt
good about killing her even if it was essential i cant
pretend ill miss her but i have to admire her my
guess is if they had given us some sort of test she
would have been the smartest of all the tributes if in
fact we had been setting a trap for her i bet shed
have sensed it and avoided the berries it was peetas
own ignorance that brought her down ive spent so
much time making sure i dont underestimate my
opponents that ive forgotten its just as dangerous to
overestimate them as well
that brings me back to cato but while i think i had
a sense of foxface who she was and how she
operated hes a little more slippery powerful well
trained but smart i dont know not like she was
and utterly lacking in the control foxface
demonstrated i believe cato could easily lose his
judgment in a fit of temper not that i can feel
superior on that point i think of the moment i sent
the arrow flying into the apple in the pigs mouth
when i was so enraged maybe i do understand cato
better than i think
despite the fatigue in my body my minds alert so i
let peeta sleep long past our usual switch in fact a
soft gray day has begun when i shake his shoulder
he looks out almost in alarm i slept the whole
night thats not fair katniss you should have woken
me
i stretch and burrow down into the bag ill sleep
now wake me if anything interesting happens
apparently nothing does because when i open my
eyes bright hot afternoon light gleams through the
rocks any sign of our friend i ask

peeta shakes his head no hes keeping a
disturbingly low profile
how long do you think well have before the
gamemakers drive us together i ask
well foxface died almost a day ago so theres been
plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get
bored i guess it could happen at any moment says
peeta
yeah i have a feeling todays the day i say i sit up
and look out at the peaceful terrain i wonder how
theyll do it
peeta remains silent theres not really any good
answer
well until they do no sense in wasting a hunting
day but we should probably eat as much as we can
hold just in case we run into trouble i say
peeta packs up our gear while i lay out a big meal
the rest of the rabbits roots greens the rolls spread
with the last bit of cheese the only thing i leave in
reserve is the squirrel and the apple
by the time were done all thats left is a pile of rabbit
bones my hands are greasy which only adds to my
growing feeling of grubbiness maybe we dont bathe
daily in the seam but we keep cleaner than i have of
late except for my feet which have walked in the
stream im covered in a layer of grime
leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it i
dont think there will be another night in the arena
somehow one way or the other dead or alive i have
the feeling 111 escape it today i give the rocks a pat
goodbye and we head down to the stream to wash

up i can feel my skin itching for the cool water i
may do my hair and braid it back wet im wondering
if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick
scrub when we reach the stream or what used to be
the stream now theres only a bonedry bed i put my
hand down to feel it
not even a little damp they must have drained it
while we slept i say a fear of the cracked tongue
aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my
previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness
our bottles and skin are fairly full but with two
drinking and this hot sun it wont take long to deplete
them
the lake says peeta thats where they want us to
go
maybe the ponds still have some i say hopefully
we can check he says but hes just humoring me
im humoring myself because i know what ill find
when we return to the pond where i soaked my leg a
dusty gaping mouth of a hole but we make the trip
anyway just to confirm what we already know
youre right theyre driving us to the lake i say
where theres no cover where theyre guaranteed a
bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their
view do you want to go straightaway or wait until
the waters tapped out
lets go now while weve had food and rest lets just
go end this thing he says
i nod its funny i feel almost as if its the first day of
the games again that im in the same position
twentyone tributes are dead but i still have yet to
kill cato and really wasnt he always the one to kill

now it seems the other tributes were just minor
obstacles distractions keeping us from the real
battle of the games cato and me
but no theres the boy waiting beside me i feel his
arms wrap around me
two against one should be a piece of cake he says
next time we eat it will be in the capitol i answer
you bet it will he says
we stand there a while locked in an embrace feeling
each other the sunlight the rustle of the leaves at
our feet then without a word we break apart and
head for the lake
i dont care now that peetas footfalls send rodents
scurrying make birds take wing we have to fight
cato and id just as soon do it here as on the plain
but i doubt ill have that choice if the gamemakers
want us in the open then in the open we will be
we stop to rest for a few moments under the tree
where the careers trapped me the husk of the
tracker jacker nest beaten to a pulp by the heavy
rains and dried in the burning sun confirms the
location i touch it with the tip of my boot and it
dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the
breeze i cant help looking up in the tree where rue
secretly perched waiting to save my life tracker
j ackers glimmers bloated body the terrifying
hallucinations
lets move on i say wanting to escape the darkness
that surrounds this place peeta doesnt object

given our late start to the day when we reach the
plain its already early evening theres no sign of
cato no sign of anything except the gold cornucopia
glowing in the slanting sun rays just in case cato
decided to pull a foxface on us we circle the
cornucopia to make sure its empty then obediently
as if following instructions we cross to the lake and
fill our water containers
i frown at the shrinking sun we dont want to fight
him after dark theres only the one pair of glasses
peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the
water maybe thats what hes waiting for what do
you want to do go back to the cave
either that or find a tree but lets give him another
half an hour or so then well take cover i answer
we sit by the lake in full sight theres no point in
hiding now in the trees at the edge of the plain i can
see the mockingjays flitting about bouncing melodies
back and forth between them like brightly colored
balls i open my mouth and sing out rues fournote
run i can feel them pause curiously at the sound of
my voice listening for more i repeat the notes in the
silence first one mockingjay trills the tune back
then another then the whole world comes alive with
the sound
just like your father says peeta
my fingers find the pin on my shirt thats rues
song i say i think they remember it
the music swells and i recognize the brilliance of it
as the notes overlap they compliment one another
forming a lovely unearthly harmony it was this
sound then thanks to rue that sent the orchard

workers of district 1 1 home each night does
someone start it at quitting time i wonder now that
she is dead
for a while i just close my eyes and listen
mesmerized by the beauty of the song then
something begins to disrupt the music runs cut off
in jagged imperfect lines dissonant notes intersperse
with the melody the mockingjays voices rise up in a
shrieking cry of alarm
were on our feet peeta wielding his knife me poised
to shoot when cato smashes through the trees and
bears down on us he has no spear in fact his hands
are empty yet he runs straight for us my first arrow
hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside
hes got some kind of body armor i shout to peeta
just in time too because cato is upon us i brace
myself but he rockets right between us with no
attempt to check his speed i can tell from his
panting the sweat pouring off his purplish face that
hes been running hard a long time not toward us
from something but what
my eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first
creature leap onto the plain as im turning away i
see another half dozen join it then i am stumbling
blindly after cato with no thought of anything but to
save myself

muttations no question about it ive never seen
these mutts but theyre no naturalborn animals
they resemble huge wolves but what wolf lands and
then balances easily on its hind legs what wolf
waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw
as though it had a wrist these things i can see at a
distance up close im sure their more menacing
attributes will be revealed
cato has made a beeline for the cornucopia and
without question i follow him if he thinks its the
safest place who am i to argue besides even if i
could make it to the trees it would be impossible for
peeta to outrun them on that leg — peeta my hands
have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of
the cornucopia when i remember im part of a team
hes about fifteen yards behind me hobbling as fast
as he can but the mutts are closing in on him fast i
send an arrow into the pack and one goes down but
there are plenty to take its place
peetas waving me up the horn go katniss go
hes right i cant protect either of us on the ground i
start climbing scaling the cornucopia on my hands
and feet the pure gold surface has been designed to
resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest so
there are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold
on but after a day in the arena sun the metal feels
hot enough to blister my hands
cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn
twenty feet above the ground gasping to catch his
breath as he gags over the edge nows my chance to
finish him off i stop midway up the horn and load

another arrow but just as im about to let it fly i
hear peeta cry out i twist around and see hes just
reached the tail and the mutts are right on his heels
climb i yell peeta starts up hampered by not only
the leg but the knife in his hand i shoot my arrow
down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws
on the metal as it dies the creature lashes out
inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its
companions thats when i get a look at the claws
four inches and clearly razorsharp
peeta reaches my feet and i grab his arm and pull
him along then i remember cato waiting at the top
and whip around but hes doubled over with cramps
and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts
than us he coughs out something unintelligible the
snuffling growling sound coming from the mutts isnt
helping
what i shout at him
he said can they climb it answers peeta drawing
my focus back to the base of the horn
the mutts are beginning to assemble as they join
together they raise up again to stand easily on their
back legs giving them an eerily human quality each
has a thick coat some with fur that is straight and
sleek others curly and the colors vary from jet black
to what i can only describe as blond theres
something else about them something that makes
the hair rise up on the back of my neck but i cant
put my finger on it
they put their snouts on the horn sniffing and
tasting the metal scraping paws over the surface and
then making highpitched yipping sounds to one
another this must be how they communicate

because the pack backs up as if to make room then
one of them a goodsize mutt with silky waves of
blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the
horn its back legs must be incredibly powerful
because it lands a mere ten feet below us its pink
lips pulled back in a snarl for a moment it hangs
there and in that moment i realize what else
unsettled me about the mutts the green eyes
glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf any
canine ive ever seen they are unmistakably human
and that revelation has barely registered when i
notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels
and the whole horrible thing hits me the blonde hair
the green eyes the number  its glimmer
a shriek escapes my lips and im having trouble
holding the arrow in place i have been waiting to fire
only too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows
waiting to see if the creatures can in fact climb but
now even though the mutt has begun to slide
backward unable to find any purchase on the metal
even though i can hear the slow screeching of the
claws like nails on a blackboard i fire into its throat
its body twitches and flops onto the ground with a
thud
katniss i can feel peetas grip on my arm
its her i get out
who asks peeta
my head snaps from side to side as i examine the
pack taking in the various sizes and colors the
small one with the red coat and amber eyes
foxface and there the ashen hair and hazel eyes of
the boy from district 9 who died as we struggled for
the backpack and worst of all the smallest mutt
with dark glossy fur huge brown eyes and a collar

that reads 1 1 in woven straw teeth bared in hatred
rue
what is it katniss peeta shakes my shoulder
its them its all of them the others rue and
foxface and  all of the other tributes i choke out
i hear peetas gasp of recognition what did they do
to them you dont think    those could be their real
eyes
their eyes are the least of my worries what about
their brains have they been given any of the real
tributes memories have they been programmed to
hate our faces particularly because we have survived
and they were so callously murdered and the ones
we actually killed  do they believe theyre avenging
their own deaths
before i can get this out the mutts begin a new
assault on the horn theyve split into two groups at
the sides of the horn and are using those powerful
hindquarters to launch themselves at us a pair of
teeth ring together just inches from my hand and
then i hear peeta cry out feel the yank on his body
the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the
side if not for the grip on my arm hed be on the
ground but as it is it takes all my strength to keep
us both on the curved back of the horn and more
tributes are coming
kill it peeta kill it im shouting and although i
cant quite see whats happening i know he must
have stabbed the thing because the pull lessens im
able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag
ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils
awaits

cato has still not regained his feet but his breathing
is slowing and i know soon hell be recovered enough
to come for us to hurl us over the side to our deaths
i arm my bow but the arrow ends up taking out a
mutt that can only be thresh who else could jump
so high i feel a moments relief because we must
finally be up above the mutt line and im just turning
back to face cato when peetas jerked from my side
im sure the pack has got him until his blood
splatters my face
cato stands before me almost at the lip of the horn
holding peeta in some kind of headlock cutting off his
air peetas clawing at catos arm but weakly as if
confused over whether its more important to breathe
or try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping
hole a mutt left in his calf
i aim one of my last two arrows at catos head
knowing it 11 have no effect on his trunk or limbs
which i can now see are clothed in a skintight flesh
colored mesh some highgrade body armor from the
capitol was that what was in his pack at the feast
body armor to defend against my arrows well they
neglected to send a face guard
cato just laughs shoot me and he goes down with
me
hes right if i take him out and he falls to the mutts
peeta is sure to die with him weve reached a
stalemate i cant shoot cato without killing peeta
too he cant kill peeta without guaranteeing an arrow
in his brain we stand like statues both of us seeking
an out
my muscles are strained so tightly they feel they
might snap at any moment my teeth clenched to the

breaking point the mutts go silent and the only thing
i can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear
peetas lips are turning blue if i dont do something
quickly hell die of asphyxiation and then 111 have
lost him and cato will probably use his body as a
weapon against me in fact im sure this is catos
plan because while hes stopped laughing his lips are
set in a triumphant smile
as if in a lastditch effort peeta raises his fingers
dripping with blood from his leg up to catos arm
instead of trying to wrestle his way free his forefinger
veers off and makes a deliberate x on the back of
catos hand cato realizes what it means exactly one
second after i do i can tell by the way the smile drops
from his lips but its one second too late because by
that time my arrow is piercing his hand he cries out
and reflexively releases peeta who slams back against
him for a horrible moment i think theyre both going
over i dive forward just catching hold of peeta as
cato loses his footing on the bloodslick horn and
plummets to the ground
we hear him hit the air leaving his body on impact
and then the mutts attack him peeta and i hold on to
each other waiting for the cannon waiting for the
competition to finish waiting to be released but it
doesnt happen not yet because this is the climax of
the hunger games and the audience expects a show
i dont watch but i can hear the snarls the growls
the howls of pain from both human and beast as cato
takes on the mutt pack i cant understand how he
can be surviving until i remember the body armor
protecting him from ankle to neck and i realize what a
long night this could be cato must have a knife or
sword or something too something he had hidden in
his clothes because on occasion theres the death

scream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as
the blade collides with the golden horn the combat
moves around the side of the cornucopia and i know
cato must be attempting the one maneuver that
could save his life — to make his way back around to
the tail of the horn and rejoin us but in the end
despite his remarkable strength and skill he is
simply overpowered
i dont know how long it has been maybe an hour or
so when cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts
dragging him dragging him back into the
cornucopia now theyll finish him off i think but
theres still no cannon
night falls and the anthem plays and theres no
picture of cato in the sky only the faint moans
coming through the metal beneath us the icy air
blowing across the plain reminds me that the games
are not over and may not be for who knows how long
and there is still no guarantee of victory
i turn my attention to peeta and discover his leg is
bleeding as badly as ever all our supplies our packs
remain down by the lake where we abandoned them
when we fled from the mutts i have no bandage
nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf
although im shaking in the biting wind i rip off my
jacket remove my shirt and zip back into the jacket
as swiftly as possible that brief exposure sets my
teeth chattering beyond control
peetas face is gray in the pale moonlight i make him
lie down before i probe his wound warm slippery
blood runs over my fingers a bandage will not be
enough ive seen my mother tie a tourniquet a
handful of times and try to replicate it i cut free a
sleeve from my shirt wrap it twice around his leg just
under his knee and tie a half knot i dont have a

stick so i take my remaining arrow and insert it in
the knot twisting it as tightly as i dare its risky
business — peeta may end up losing his leg — but
when i weigh this against him losing his life what
alternative do i have i bandage the wound in the rest
of my shirt and lay down with him
dont go to sleep i tell him im not sure if this is
exactly medical protocol but im terrified that if he
drifts off hell never wake again
are you cold he asks he unzips his jacket and i
press against him as he fastens it around me its a
bit warmer sharing our body heat inside my double
layer of jackets but the night is young the
temperature will continue to drop
even now i can feel the cornucopia which burned so
when i first climbed it slowly turning to ice
cato may win this thing yet i whisper to peeta
dont you believe it he says pulling up my hood
but hes shaking harder than i am
the next hours are the worst in my life which if you
think about it is saying something the cold would be
torture enough but the real nightmare is listening to
cato moaning begging and finally just whimpering
as the mutts work away at him after a very short
time i dont care who he is or what hes done all i
want is for his suffering to end
why dont they just kill him i ask peeta
you know why he says and pulls me closer to him

and i do no viewer could turn away from the show
now from the gamemakers point of view this is the
final word in entertainment
it goes on and on and on and eventually completely
consumes my mind blocking out memories and
hopes of tomorrow erasing everything but the
present which i begin to believe will never change
there will never be anything but cold and fear and
the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn
peeta begins to doze off now and each time he does i
find myself yelling his name louder and louder
because if he goes and dies on me now i know 111 go
completely insane hes fighting it probably more for
me than for him and its hard because
unconsciousness would be its own form of escape
but the adrenaline pumping through my body would
never allow me to follow him so i cant let him go i
just cant
the only indication of the passage of time lies in the
heavens the subtle shift of the moon so peeta begins
pointing it out to me insisting i acknowledge its
progress and sometimes for just a moment i feel a
flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs
me again
finally i hear him whisper that the sun is rising i
open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale
light of dawn i can see too how bloodless peetas
face has become how little time he has left and i
know i have to get him back to the capitol
still no cannon has fired i press my good ear against
the horn and can just make out catos voice
i think hes closer now katniss can you shoot
himpeeta asks

if hes near the mouth i may be able to take him out
it would be an act of mercy at this point
my last arrows in your tourniquet i say
make it count says peeta unzipping his jacket
letting me loose
so i free the arrow tying the tourniquet back as
tightly as my frozen fingers can manage i rub my
hands together trying to regain circulation when i
crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge i
feel peetas hands grip me for support
it takes a few moments to find cato in the dim light
in the blood then the raw hunk of meat that used to
be my enemy makes a sound and i know where his
mouth is and i think the word hes trying to say is
please
pity not vengeance sends my arrow flying into his
skull peeta pulls me back up bow in hand quiver
empty
did you get him he whispers
the cannon fires in answer
then we won katniss he says hollowly
hurray for us i get out but theres no joy of victory
in my voice
a hole opens in the plain and as if on cue the
remaining mutts bound into it disappearing as the
earth closes above them

we wait for the hovercraft to take catos remains for
the trumpets of victory that should follow but
nothing happens
hey i shout into air whats going on the only
response is the chatter of waking birds
maybe its the body maybe we have to move away
from it says peeta
i try to remember do you have to distance yourself
from the dead tribute on the final kill my brain is too
muddled to be sure but what else could be the
reason for the delay
okay think you could make it to the lake i ask
think i better try says peeta we inch down to the
tail of the horn and fall to the ground if the stiffness
in my limbs is this bad how can peeta even move i
rise first swinging and bending my arms and legs
until i think i can help him up somehow we make it
back to the lake i scoop up a handful of the cold
water for peeta and bring a second to my lips
a mockingjay gives the long low whistle and tears of
relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes
catos body away now they will take us now we can
go home
but again theres no response
what are they waiting for says peeta weakly
between the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it
took to get to the lake his wound has opened up
again
i dont know i say whatever the holdup is i cant
watch him lose any more blood i get up to find a

stick but almost immediately come across the arrow
that bounced off catos body armor it will do as well
as the other arrow as i stoop to pick it up claudius
templesmiths voice booms into the arena
greetings to the final contestants of the seventy
fourth hunger games the earlier revision has been
revoked closer examination of the rule book has
disclosed that only one winner may be allowed he
says good luck and may the odds be ever in your
favor
theres a small burst of static and then nothing more
i stare at peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in they
never intended to let us both live this has all been
devised by the gamemakers to guarantee the most
dramatic showdown in history and like a fool i
bought into it
if you think about it its not that surprising he
says softly i watch as he painfully makes it to his
feet then hes moving toward me as if in slow
motion his hand is pulling the knife from his belt —
before i am even aware of my actions my bow is
loaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart
peeta raises his eyebrows and i see the knife has
already left his hand on its way to the lake where it
splashes in the water i drop my weapons and take a
step back my face burning in what can only be
shame
no he says do it peeta limps toward me and
thrusts the weapons back in my hands
i cant i say i wont
do it before they send those mutts back or
something i dont want to die like cato he says

then you shoot me i say furiously shoving the
weapons back at him you shoot me and go home
and live with itand as i say it i know death right
here right now would be the easier of the two
you know i cant peeta says discarding the
weapons fine ill go first anyway he leans down
and rips the bandage off his leg eliminating the final
barrier between his blood and the earth
no you cant kill yourself i say im on my knees
desperately plastering the bandage back onto his
wound
katniss he says its what i want
youre not leaving me here alone i say because if
he dies 111 never go home not really ill spend the
rest of my life in this arena trying to think my way
out
listen he says pulling me to my feet we both
know they have to have a victor it can only be one of
us please take it for me and he goes on about
how he loves me what life would be without me but
ive stopped listening because his previous words are
trapped in my head thrashing desperately around
we both know they have to have a victor
yes they have to have a victor without a victor the
whole thing would blow up in the gamemakers faces
theyd have failed the capitol might possibly even be
executed slowly and painfully while the cameras
broadcast it to every screen in the country
if peeta and i were both to die or they thought we
were

my fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt freeing
it peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist
no i wont let you
trust me i whisper he holds my gaze for a long
moment then lets me go i loosen the top of the pouch
and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm
then i fill my own on the count of three
peeta leans down and kisses me once very gently
the count of three he says
we stand our backs pressed together our empty
hands locked tight
hold them out i want everyone to see he says
i spread out my fingers and the dark berries glisten
in the sun i give peetas hand one last squeeze as a
signal as a goodbye and we begin counting one
maybe im wrong two maybe they dont care if we
both die three its too late to change my mind i lift
my hand to my mouth taking one last look at the
world the berries have just passed my lips when the
trumpets begin to blare
the frantic voice of claudius templesmith shouts
above them stop stop ladies and gentlemen i am
pleased to present the victors of the seventyfourth
hunger games katniss everdeen and peeta mellark i
give you — the tributes of district twelve

i spew the berries from my mouth wiping my tongue
with the end of my shirt to make sure no juice
remains peeta pulls me to the lake where we both
flush our mouths with water and then collapse into
each others arms
you didnt swallow any i ask him
he shakes his head you
guess id be dead by now if i did i say i can see his
lips moving in reply but i cant hear him over the
roar of the crowd in the capitol that theyre playing
live over the speakers
the hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders
drop only theres no way im letting go of peeta i
keep one arm around him as i help him up and we
each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder the
electric current freezes us in place and this time im
glad because im not really sure peeta can hang on for
the whole ride and since my eyes were looking down
i can see that while our muscles are immobile
nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of
peetas leg sure enough the minute the door closes
behind us and the current stops he slumps to the
floor unconscious
my fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so
tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving
me with a fistful of black fabric doctors in sterile
white masked and gloved already prepped to
operate go into action peetas so pale and still on a
silver table tubes and wires springing out of him
every which way and for a moment i forget were out

of the games and i see the doctors as just one more
threat one more pack of mutts designed to kill him
petrified i lunge for him but im caught and thrust
back into another room and a glass door seals
between us i pound on the glass screaming my head
off everyone ignores me except for some capitol
attendant who appears behind me and offers me a
beverage
i slump down on the floor my face against the door
staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my
hand icy cold filled with orange juice a straw with a
frilly white collar how wrong it looks in my bloody
filthy hand with its dirtcaked nails and scars my
mouth waters at the smell but i place it carefully on
the floor not trusting anything so clean and pretty
through the glass i see the doctors working
feverishly on peeta their brows creased in
concentration i see the flow of liquids pumping
through the tubes watch a wall of dials and lights
that mean nothing to me im not sure but i think his
heart stops twice
its like being home again when they bring in the
hopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion
or the woman in her third day of labor or the
famished child struggling against pneumonia and my
mother and prim they wear that same look on their
faces now is the time to run away to the woods to
hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in
another part of the seam the hammers make the
coffin but im held here both by the hovercraft walls
and the same force that holds the loved ones of the
dying how often ive seen them ringed around our
kitchen table and i thought why dont they leave
why do they stay to watch
and now i know its because you have no choice

i startle when i catch someone staring at me from
only a few inches away and then realize its my own
face reflecting back in the glass wild eyes hollow
cheeks my hair in a tangled mat rabid feral mad
no wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from
me
the next thing i know weve landed back on the roof
of the training center and theyre taking peeta but
leaving me behind the door i start hurling myself
against the glass shrieking and i think i just catch a
glimpse of pink hair — it must be effie it has to be
effie coming to my rescue — when the needle jabs me
from behind
when i wake im afraid to move at first the entire
ceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to
see that im in a room containing just my bed no
doors no windows are visible the air smells of
something sharp and antiseptic my right arm has
several tubes that extend into the wall behind me im
naked but the bedclothes arc soothing against my
skin i tentatively lift my left hand above the cover
not only has it been scrubbed clean the nails are
filed in perfect ovals the scars from the burns are
less prominent i touch my cheek my lips the
puckered scar above my eyebrow and am just
running my fingers through my silken hair when i
freeze apprehensively i ruffle the hair by my left ear
no it wasnt an illusion i can hear again
i try and sit up but some sort of wide restraining
band around my waist keeps me from rising more
than a few inches the physical confinement makes
me panic and im trying to pull myself up and wriggle
my hips through the band when a portion of the wall
slides open and in steps the redheaded avox girl
carrying a tray the sight of her calms me and i stop
trying to escape i want to ask her a million

questions but im afraid any familiarity would cause
her harm obviously i am being closely monitored
she sets the tray across my thighs and presses
something that raises me to a sitting position while
she adjusts my pillows i risk one question i say it
out loud as clearly as my rusty voice will allow so
nothing will seem secretive did peeta make it she
gives me a nod and as she slips a spoon into my
hand i feel the pressure of friendship
i guess she did not wish me dead after all and peeta
has made it of course he did with all their
expensive equipment here still i hadnt been sure
until now
as the avox leaves the door closes noiselessly after
her and i turn hungrily to the tray a bowl of clear
broth a small serving of applesauce and a glass of
water this is it i think grouchily shouldnt my
homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular but
i find its an effort to finish the spare meal before me
my stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a
chestnut and i have to wonder how long ive been out
because i had no trouble eating a fairly sizable
breakfast that last morning in the arena theres
usually a lag of a few days between the end of the
competition and the presentation of the victor so that
they can put the starving wounded mess of a person
back together again somewhere cinna and portia
will be creating our wardrobes for the public
appearances haymitch and effie will be arranging
the banquet for our sponsors reviewing the questions
for our final interviews back home district 12 is
probably in chaos as they try and organize the
homecoming celebrations for peeta and me given that
the last one was close to thirty years ago

home prim and my mother gale even the thought
of prims scruffy old cat makes me smile soon i will
be home
i want to get out of this bed to see peeta and cinna
to find out more about whats been going on and why
shouldnt i i feel fine but as i start to work my way
out of the band i feel a cold liquid seeping into my
vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately
lose consciousness
this happens on and off for an indeterminate amount
of time my waking eating and even though i resist
the impulse to try and escape the bed being knocked
out again i seem to be in a strange continual
twilight only a few things register the redheaded
avox girl has not returned since the feeding my scars
are disappearing and do i imagine it or do i hear a
mans voice yelling not in the capitol accent but in
the rougher cadences of home and i cant help
having a vague comforting feeling that someone is
looking out for me
then finally the time arrives when i come to and
theres nothing plugged into my right arm the
restraint around my middle has been removed and i
am free to move about i start to sit up but am
arrested by the sight of my hands the skins
perfection smooth and glowing not only are the
scars from the arena gone but those accumulated
over years of hunting have vanished without a trace
my forehead feels like satin and when i try to find the
burn on my calf theres nothing
i slip my legs out of bed nervous about how they will
bear my weight and find them strong and steady
lying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me
flinch its what all of us tributes wore in the arena i

stare at it as if it had teeth until i remember that of
course this is what i will wear to greet my team
im dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in
front of the wall where i know theres a door even if i
cant see it when suddenly it slides open i step into a
wide deserted hall that appears to have no other
doors on it but it must and behind one of them
must be peeta now that im conscious and moving
im growing more and more anxious about him he
must be all right or the avox girl wouldnt have said
so but i need to see him for myself
peeta i call out since theres no one to ask i hear
my name in response but its not his voice its a
voice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness
effie
i turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at
the end of the hall — effie haymitch and cinna my
feet take off without hesitation maybe a victor should
show more restraint more superiority especially
when she knows this will be on tape but i dont care
i run for them and surprise even myself when i
launch into haymitch s arms first when he whispers
in my ear nice job sweetheart it doesnt sound
sarcastic effies somewhat teary and keeps patting
my hair and talking about how she told everyone we
were pearls cinna just hugs me tight and doesnt say
anything then i notice portia is absent and get a bad
feeling
wheres portia is she with peeta he is all right
isnt he i mean hes alive i blurt out
hes fine only they want to do your reunion live on
air at the ceremony says haymitch

oh thats all i say the awful moment of thinking
peetas dead again passes i guess id want to see
that myself
go on with cinna he has to get you ready says
haymitch
its a relief to be alone with cinna to feel his
protective arm around my shoulders as he guides me
away from the cameras down a few passages and to
an elevator that leads to the lobby of the training
center the hospital then is far underground even
beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying
knots and throwing spears the windows of the lobby
are darkened and a handful of guards stand on duty
no one else is there to see us cross to the tribute
elevator our footsteps echo in the emptiness and
when we ride up to the twelfth floor the faces of all
the tributes who will never return flash across my
mind and theres a heavy tight place in my chest
when the elevator doors open venia flavius and
octavia engulf me talking so quickly and ecstatically
i cant make out their words the sentiment is clear
though they are truly thrilled to see me and im
happy to see them too although not like i was to see
cinna its more in the way one might be glad to see
an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly
difficult day
they sweep me into the dining room and i get a real
meal — roast beef and peas and soft rolls — although
my portions are still being strictly controlled because
when i ask for seconds im refused
no no no they dont want it all coming back up on
the stage says octavia but she secretly slips me an
extra roll under the table to let me know shes on my
side

we go back to my room and cinna disappears for a
while as the prep team gets me ready
oh they did a full body polish on you says flavius
enviously not a flaw left on your skin
but when i look at my naked body in the mirror all i
can see is how skinny i am i mean im sure i was
worse when i came out of the arena but i can easily
count my ribs
they take care of the shower settings for me and they
go to work on my hair nails and makeup when im
done they chatter so continuously that i barely have
to reply which is good since i dont feel very
talkative its funny because even though theyre
rattling on about the games its all about where they
were or what they were doing or how they felt when a
specific event occurred i was still in bed i had just
had my eyebrows dyed i swear i nearly fainted
everything is about them not the dying boys and
girls in the arena
we dont wallow around in the games this way in
district 12 we grit our teeth and watch because we
must and try to get back to business as soon as
possible when theyre over to keep from hating the
prep team i effectively tune out most of what theyre
saying
cinna comes in with what appears to be an
unassuming yellow dress across his arms
have you given up the whole girl on fire thing i
ask
you tell me he says and slips it over my head i
immediately notice the padding over my breasts

adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body
my hands go to my chest and i frown
i know says cinna before i can object but the
gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically
haymitch had a huge fight with them over it this
was the compromise he stops me before i can look
at my reflection wait dont forget the shoes venia
helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and i turn
to the mirror
i am still the girl on fire the sheer fabric softly
glows even the slight movement in the air sends a
ripple up my body by comparison the chariot
costume seems garish the interview dress too
contrived in this dress i give the illusion of wearing
candlelight
what do you think asks cinna
i think its the best yet i say when i manage to pull
my eyes away from the flickering fabric im in for
something of a shock my hairs loose held back by a
simple hairband the makeup rounds and fills out the
sharp angles of my face a clear polish coats my nails
the sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs not my
waist largely eliminating any help the padding would
have given my figure the hem falls just to my knees
without heels you can see my true stature i look
very simply like a girl a young one fourteen at the
most innocent harmless yes it is shocking that
cinna has pulled this off when you remember ive just
won the games
this is a very calculated look nothing cinna designs
is arbitrary i bite my lip trying to figure out his
motivation

i thought itd be something more  sophisticated
looking i say
i thought peeta would like this better he answers
carefully
peeta no its not about peeta its about the capitol
and the gamemakers and the audience although i do
not yet understand cinnas design its a reminder the
games are not quite finished and beneath his benign
reply i sense a warning of something he cant even
mention in front of his own team
we take the elevator to the level where we trained its
customary for the victor and his or her support team
to rise from beneath the stage first the prep team
followed by the escort the stylist the mentor and
finally the victor only this year with two victors who
share both an escort and a mentor the whole thing
has had to be rethought i find myself in a poorly lit
area under the stage a brandnew metal plate has
been installed to transport me upward you can still
see small piles of sawdust smell fresh paint cinna
and the prep team peel off to change into their own
costumes and take their positions leaving me alone
in the gloom i see a makeshift wall about ten yards
away and assume peetas behind it
the rumbling of the crowd is loud so i dont notice
haymitch until he touches my shoulder i spring
away startled still half in the arena i guess
easy just me lets have a look at you haymitch
says i hold out my arms and turn once good
enough
its not much of a compliment but what i say

haymitchs eyes shift around my musty holding
space and he seems to make a decision but
nothing how about a hug for luck
okay thats an odd request from haymitch but after
all we are victors maybe a hug for luck is in order
only when i put my arms around his neck i find
myself trapped in his embrace he begins talking
very fast very quietly in my ear my hair concealing
his lips
listen up youre in trouble word is the capitols
furious about you showing them up in the arena the
one thing they cant stand is being laughed at and
theyre the joke of panemsays haymitch
i feel dread coursing through me now but i laugh as
though haymitch is saying something completely
delightful because nothing is covering my mouth so
what
your only defense can be you were so madly in love
you werent responsible for your actions haymitch
pulls back and adjusts my hairband got it
sweetheart he could be talking about anything now
got it i say did you tell peeta this
dont have to says haymitch hes already there
but you think im not i say taking the opportunity
to straighten a bright red bow tie cinna must have
wrestled him into
since when does it matter what i think says
haymitch better take our places he leads me to the
metal circle this is your night sweetheart enjoy it
he kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the
gloom

i tug on my skirt willing it to be longer wanting it to
cover the knocking in my knees then i realize its
pointless my whole bodys shaking like a leaf
hopefully it will be put down to excitement after all
its my night
the damp moldy smell beneath the stage threatens
to choke me a cold clammy sweat breaks out on my
skin and i cant rid myself of the feeling that the
boards above my head are about to collapse to bury
me alive under the rubble when i left the arena
when the trumpets played i was supposed to be safe
from then on for the rest of my life but if what
haymitch says is true and hes got no reason to lie
ive never been in such a dangerous place in my life
its so much worse than being hunted in the arena
there i could only die end of story but out here
prim my mother gale the people of district 12
everyone i care about back home could be punished if
i cant pull off the girldrivencrazybylove scenario
haymitch has suggested
so i still have a chance though funny in the arena
when i poured out those berries i was only thinking
of outsmarting the gamemakers not how my actions
would reflect on the capitol but the hunger games
are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able
to defeat it so now the capitol will act as if theyve
been in control the whole time as if they orchestrated
the whole event right down to the double suicide but
that will only work if i play along with them
and peeta  peeta will suffer too if this goes wrong
but what was it haymitch said when i asked if he had
told peeta the situation that he had to pretend to be
desperately in love
dont have to hes already there

already thinking ahead of me in the games again and
well aware of the danger were in or  already
desperately in love i dont know i havent even
begun to separate out my feelings about peeta its too
complicated what i did as part of the games as
opposed to what i did out of anger at the capitol or
because of how it would be viewed back in district 12
or simply because it was the only decent thing to do
or what i did because i cared about him
these are questions to be unraveled back home in
the peace and quiet of the woods when no one is
watching not here with every eye upon me but i
wont have that luxury for who knows how long and
right now the most dangerous part of the hunger
games is about to begin

the anthem booms in my ears and then i hear
caesar flickerman greeting the audience does he
know how crucial it is to get every word right from
now on he must he will want to help us the crowd
breaks into applause as the prep teams are
presented i imagine flavius venia and octavia
bouncing around and taking ridiculous bobbing
bows its a safe bet theyre clueless then effies
introduced how long shes waited for this moment i
hope shes able to enjoy it because as misguided as
effie can be she has a very keen instinct about
certain things and must at least suspect were in
trouble portia and cinna receive huge cheers of
course theyve been brilliant had a dazzling debut i
now understand cinna s choice of dress for me for
tonight ill need to look as girlish and innocent as
possible haymitchs appearance brings a round of
stomping that goes on at least five minutes well hes
accomplished a first keeping not only one but two
tributes alive what if he hadnt warned me in time
would i have acted differently flaunted the moment
with the berries in the capitols face no i dont think
so but i could easily have been a lot less convincing
than i need to be now right now because i can feel
the plate lifting me up to the stage
blinding lights the deafening roar rattles the metal
under my feet then theres peeta just a few yards
away he looks so clean and healthy and beautiful i
can hardly recognize him but his smile is the same
whether in mud or in the capitol and when i see it i
take about three steps and fling myself into his arms
he staggers back almost losing his balance and
thats when i realize the slim metal contraption in his
hand is some kind of cane he rights himself and we

just cling to each other while the audience goes
insane hes kissing me and all the time im thinking
do you know do you know how much danger were
in after about ten minutes of this caesar
flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the
show and peeta just pushes him aside without even
glancing at him the audience goes berserk whether
he knows or not peeta is as usual playing the crowd
exactly right
finally haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good
natured shove toward the victors chair usually this
is a single ornate chair from which the winning
tribute watches a film of the highlights of the games
but since there are two of us the gamemakers have
provided a plush red velvet couch a small one my
mother would call it a love seat i think i sit so close
to peeta that im practically on his lap but one look
from haymitch tells me it isnt enough kicking off my
sandals i tuck my feet to the side and lean my head
against peetas shoulder his arm goes around me
automatically and i feel like im back in the cave
curled up against him trying to keep warm his shirt
is made of the same yellow material as my dress but
portias put him in long black pants no sandals
either but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps
solidly planted on the stage i wish cinna had given
me a similar outfit i feel so vulnerable in this flimsy
dress but i guess that was the point
caesar flickerman makes a few more jokes and then
its time for the show this will last exactly three
hours and is required viewing for all of panem as the
lights dim and the seal appears on the screen i
realize im unprepared for this i do not want to watch
my twenty two fellow tributes die i saw enough of
them die the first time my heart starts pounding and
i have a strong impulse to run how have the other
victors faced this alone during the highlights they

periodically show the winners reaction up on a box in
the corner of the screen i think back to earlier years
  some are triumphant pumping their fists in the
air beating their chests most just seem stunned all
i know is that the only thing keeping me on this love
seat is peeta — his arm around my shoulder his
other hand claimed by both of mine of course the
previous victors didnt have the capitol looking for a
way to destroy them
condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a
feat especially when you consider how many cameras
were going at once whoever puts together the
highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell
this year for the first time they tell a love story i
know peeta and i won but a disproportionate amount
of time is spent on us right from the beginning im
glad though because it supports the whole crazyin
love thing thats my defense for defying the capitol
plus it means we wont have as much time to linger
over the deaths
the first half hour or so focuses on the prearena
events the reaping the chariot ride through the
capitol our training scores and our interviews
theres this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under
it that makes it twice as awful because of course
almost everyone onscreen is dead
once were in the arena theres detailed coverage of
the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically
alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of
us mostly peeta really theres no question hes
carrying this romance thing on his shoulders now i
see what the audience saw how he misled the
careers about me stayed awake the entire night
under the tracker j acker tree fought cato to let me
escape and even while he lay in that mud bank
whispered my name in his sleep i seem heartless in

comparison — dodging fireballs dropping nests and
blowing up supplies — until i go hunting for rue
they play her death in full the spearing my failed
rescue attempt my arrow through the boy from
district 1 s throat rue drawing her last breath in my
arms and the song i get to sing every note of the
song something inside me shuts down and im too
numb to feel anything its like watching complete
strangers in another hunger games but i do notice
they omit the part where i covered her in flowers
right because even that smacks of rebellion
things pick up for me once theyve announced two
tributes from the same district can live and i shout
out peetas name and then clap my hands over my
mouth if ive seemed indifferent to him earlier i
make up for it now by finding him nursing him back
to health going to the feast for the medicine and
being very free with my kisses objectively i can see
the mutts and catos death are as gruesome as ever
but again i feel it happens to people i have never met
and then comes the moment with the berries i can
hear the audience hushing one another not wanting
to miss anything a wave of gratitude to the
filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with
the announcement of our victory but with me
pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft
screaming peetas name as they try to revive him
in terms of survival its my best moment all night
the anthems playing yet again and we rise as
president snow himself takes the stage followed by a
little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown
theres just one crown though and you can hear the
crowds confusion — whose head will he place it on
— until president snow gives it a twist and it

separates into two halves he places the first around
peetas brow with a smile hes still smiling when he
settles the second on my head but his eyes just
inches from mine are as unforgiving as a snakes
thats when i know that even though both of us
would have eaten the berries i am to blame for
having the idea im the instigator im the one to be
punished
much bowing and cheering follows my arm is about
to fall off from waving when caesar flickerman finally
bids the audience good night reminding them to tune
in tomorrow for the final interviews as if they have a
choice
peeta and i are whisked to the presidents mansion
for the victory banquet where we have very little time
to eat as capitol officials and particularly generous
sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try
to get their picture with us face after beaming face
flashes by becoming increasingly intoxicated as the
evening wears on occasionally i catch a glimpse of
haymitch which is reassuring or president snow
which is terrifying but i keep laughing and thanking
people and smiling as my picture is taken the one
thing i never do is let go of peetas hand
the sun is just peeking over the horizon when we
straggle back to the twelfth floor of the training
center i think now 111 finally get a word alone with
peeta but haymitch sends him off with portia to get
something fitted for the interview and personally
escorts me to my door
why cant i talk to him i ask
plenty of time for talk when we get home says
haymitch go to bed youre on air at two

despite haymitchs running interference im
determined to see peeta privately after i toss and
turn for a few hours i slip into the hall my first
thought is to check the roof but its empty even the
city streets far below are deserted after the
celebration last night i go back to bed for a while and
then decide to go directly to his room but when i try
to turn the knob i find my own bedroom door has
been locked from the outside i suspect haymitch
initially but then theres a more insidious fear that
the capitol may by monitoring and confining me ive
been unable to escape since the hunger games
began but this feels different much more personal
this feels like ive been imprisoned for a crime and
im awaiting sentencing i quickly get back in bed and
pretend to sleep until effie trinket comes to alert me
to the start of another big big big day
i have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain
and stew before the prep team descends all i have to
say is the crowd loved you and its unnecessary to
speak for the next couple of hours when cinna
comes in he shoos them out and dresses me in a
white gauzy dress and pink shoes then he
personally adjusts my makeup until i seem to radiate
a soft rosy glow we make idle chitchat but im
afraid to ask him anything of real importance because
after the incident with the door i cant shake the
feeling that im being watched constantly
the interview takes place right down the hall in the
sitting room a space has been cleared and the love
seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of
red and pink roses there are only a handful of
cameras to record the event no live audience at least
caesar flickerman gives me a warm hug when i
come in congratulations katniss how are you
faring

fine nervous about the interview i say
dont be were going to have a fabulous time he
says giving my cheek a reassuring pat
im not good at talking about myself i say
nothing you say will be wrong he says
and i think oh caesar if only that were true but
actually president snow may be arranging some sort
ofaccident for me as we speak
then peetas there looking handsome in red and
white pulling me off to the side i hardly get to see
you haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart
haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive but
there are too many ears listening so i just say yes
hes gotten very responsible lately
well theres just this and we go home then he cant
watch us all the time says peeta
i feel a sort of shiver run through me and theres no
time to analyze why because theyre ready for us we
sit somewhat formally on the love seat but caesar
says oh go ahead and curl up next to him if you
want it looked very sweet so i tuck my feet up and
peeta pulls me in close to him
someone counts backward and just like that were
being broadcast live to the entire country caesar
flickerman is wonderful teasing joking getting
choked up when the occasion presents itself he and
peeta already have the rapport they established that
night of the first interview that easy banter so i just
smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible i

mean i have to talk some but as soon as i can i
redirect the conversation back to peeta
eventually though caesar begins to pose questions
that insist on fuller answers well peeta we know
from our days in the cave that it was love at first
sight for you from what age five caesar says
from the moment i laid eyes on her says peeta
but katniss what a ride for you i think the real
excitement for the audience was watching you fall for
him when did you realize you were in love with him
asks caesar
oh thats a hard one  i give a faint breathy laugh
and look down at my hands help
well i know when it hit me the night when you
shouted out his name from that tree says caesar
thank you caesar i think and then go with his idea
yes i guess that was it i mean until that point i
just tried not to think about what my feelings might
be honestly because it was so confusing and it only
made things worse if i actually cared about him but
then in the tree everything changed i say
why do you think that was urges caesar
maybe    because for the first time    there was a
chance i could keep him i say
behind a cameraman i see haymitch give a sort of
huff with relief and i know ive said the right thing
caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a
moment because hes so moved i can feel peeta press
his forehead into my temple and he asks so now

that youve got me what are you going to do with
me
i turn in to him put you somewhere you cant get
hurt and when he kisses me people in the room
actually sigh
for caesar this is a natural place to segue into all
the ways we did get hurt in the arena from burns to
stings to wounds but its not until we get around to
the mutts that i forget im on camera when caesar
asks peeta how his new leg is working out
new leg i say and i cant help reaching out and
pulling up the bottom of peetas pants oh no i
whisper taking in the metalandplastic device that
has replaced his flesh
no one told you asks caesar gently i shake my
head
i havent had the chance says peeta with a slight
shrug
its my fault i say because i used that tourniquet
yes its your fault im alive says peeta
hes right says caesar hed have bled to death for
sure without it
i guess this is true but i cant help feeling upset
about it to the extent that im afraid i might cry and
then i remember everyone in the country is watching
me so i just bury my face in peetas shirt it takes
them a couple of minutes to coax me back out
because its better in the shirt where no one can see
me and when i do come out caesar backs off

questioning me so i can recover in fact he pretty
much leaves me alone until the berries come up
katniss i know youve had a shock but ive got to
ask the moment when you pulled out those berries
what was going on in your mind  hm he says
i take a long pause before i answer trying to collect
my thoughts this is the crucial moment where i
either challenged the capitol or went so crazy at the
idea of losing peeta that i cant be held responsible for
my actions it seems to call for a big dramatic
speech but all i get out is one almost inaudible
sentence i dont know i just  couldnt bear the
thought of  being without him
peeta anything to add asks caesar
no i think that goes for both of us he says
caesar signs off and its over everyones laughing
and crying and hugging but im still not sure until i
reach haymitchokay i whisper
perfect he answers
i go back to my room to collect a few things and find
theres nothing to take but the mockingjay pin madge
gave me someone returned it to my room after the
games they drive us through the streets in a car
with blackened windows and the trains waiting for
us we barely have time to say goodbye to cinna and
portia although well see them in a few months when
we tour the districts for a round of victory
ceremonies its the capitols way of reminding people
that the hunger games never really go away well be
given a lot of useless plaques and everyone will have
to pretend they love us

the train begins moving and were plunged into night
until we clear the tunnel and i take my first free
breath since the reaping effie is accompanying us
back and haymitch too of course we eat an
enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the
television to watch a replay of the interview with the
capitol growing farther away every second i begin to
think of home of prim and my mother of gale i
excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a
plain shirt and pants as i slowly thoroughly wash
the makeup from my face and put my hair in its
braid i begin transforming back into myself katniss
everdeen a girl who lives in the seam hunts in the
woods trades in the hob i stare in the mirror as i try
to remember who i am and who i am not by the time
i join the others the pressure of peetas arm around
my shoulders feels alien
when the train makes a brief stop for fuel were
allowed to go outside for some fresh air theres no
longer any need to guard us peeta and i walk down
along the track hand in hand and i cant find
anything to say now that were alone he stops to
gather a bunch of wildflowers for me when he
presents them i work hard to look pleased because
he cant know that the pinkandwhite flowers are the
tops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours
ive spent gathering them with gale
gale the idea of seeing gale in a matter of hours
makes my stomach churn but why i cant quite
frame it in my mind i only know that i feel like ive
been lying to someone who trusts me or more
accurately to two people ive been getting away with
it up to this point because of the games but there
will be no games to hide behind back home
whats wrong peeta asks

nothing i answer we continue walking past the
end of the train out where even im fairly sure there
are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along
the track still no words come
haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my
back even now in the middle of nowhere he keeps
his voice down great job you two just keep it up in
the district until the cameras are gone we should be
okay i watch him head back to the train avoiding
peetas eyes
whats he mean peeta asks me
its the capitol they didnt like our stunt with the
berries i blurt out
what what are you talking about he says
it seemed too rebellious so haymitch has been
coaching me through the last few days so i didnt
make it worse i say
coaching you but not me says peeta
he knew you were smart enough to get it right i
say
i didnt know there was anything to get right says
peeta so what youre saying is these last few days
and then i guess    back in the arena    that was just
some strategy you two worked out
no i mean i couldnt even talk to him in the arena
could i i stammer
but you knew what he wanted you to do didnt
yousays peeta i bite my lip katniss he drops my
hand and i take a step as if to catch my balance

it was all for the games peeta says how you
acted
not all of it i say tightly holding onto my flowers
then how much no forget that i guess the real
question is whats going to be left when we get home
he says
i dont know the closer we get to district twelve the
more confused i get i say he waits for further
explanation but nones forthcoming
well let me know when you work it out he says
and the pain in his voice is palpable
i know my ears are healed because even with the
rumble of the engine i can hear every step he takes
back to the train by the time ive climbed aboard
peeta has disappeared into his room for the night i
dont see him the next morning either in fact the
next time he turns up were pulling into district 12
he gives me a nod his face expressionless
i want to tell him that hes not being fair that we
were strangers that i did what it took to stay alive to
keep us both alive in the arena that i cant explain
how things are with gale because i dont know
myself that its no good loving me because im never
going to get married anyway and hed just end up
hating me later instead of sooner that if i do have
feelings for him it doesnt matter because ill never be
able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family to
children and how can he how can he after what
weve just been through
i also want to tell him how much i already miss him
but that wouldnt be fair on my part

so we just stand there silently watching our grimy
little station rise up around us through the window
i can see the platforms thick with cameras everyone
will be eagerly watching our homecoming
out of the corner of my eye i see peeta extend his
hand i look at him unsure one more time for the
audience he says his voice isnt angry its hollow
which is worse already the boy with the bread is
slipping away from me
i take his hand holding on tightly preparing for the
cameras and dreading the moment when i will finally
have to let go

end of book one
