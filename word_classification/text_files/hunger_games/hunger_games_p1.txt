hunger
games
parti
the tributes

when i wake up the other side of the bed is cold my
fingers stretch out seeking prims warmth but finding
only the rough canvas cover of the mattress she
must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our
mother of course she did this is the day of the
reaping
i prop myself up on one elbow theres enough light in
the bedroom to see them my little sister prim curled
up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their
cheeks pressed together in sleep my mother looks
younger still worn but not so beatendown prims
face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely as the
primrose for which she was named my mother was
very beautiful once too or so they tell me
sitting at prims knees guarding her is the worlds
ugliest cat mashedin nose half of one ear missing
eyes the color of rotting squash prim named him
buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat
matched the bright flower i le hates me or at least
distrusts me even though it was years ago i think he
still remembers how i tried to drown him in a bucket
when prim brought him home scrawny kitten belly
swollen with worms crawling with fleas the last
thing i needed was another mouth to feed but prim
begged so hard cried even i had to let him stay it
turned out okay my mother got rid of the vermin and
hes a born mouser even catches the occasional rat
sometimes when i clean a kill i feed buttercup the
entrails he has stopped hissing at me
entrails no hissing this is the closest we will ever
come to love

i swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting
boots supple leather that has molded to my feet i
pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up
into a cap and grab my forage bag on the table
under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats
and cats alike sits a perfect little goat cheese
wrapped in basil leaves prims gift to me on reaping
day i put the cheese carefully in my pocket as i slip
outside
our part of district 12 nicknamed the seam is
usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the
morning shift at this hour men and women with
hunched shoulders swollen knuckles many who
have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust
out of their broken nails the lines of their sunken
faces but today the black cinder streets are empty
shutters on the squat gray houses are closed the
reaping isnt until two may as well sleep in if you
can
our house is almost at the edge of the seam i only
have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field
called the meadow separating the meadow from the
woods in fact enclosing all of district 12 is a high
chainlink fence topped with barbedwire loops in
theory its supposed to be electrified twentyfour
hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live
in the woods — packs of wild dogs lone cougars
bears — that used to threaten our streets but since
were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in
the evenings its usually safe to touch even so i
always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum
that means the fence is live right now its silent as a
stone concealed by a clump of bushes i flatten out
on my belly and slide under a twofoot stretch thats
been loose for years there are several other weak
spots in the fence but this one is so close to home i
almost always enter the woods here

as soon as im in the trees i retrieve a bow and
sheath of arrows from a hollow log electrified or not
the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh
eaters out of district 12 inside the woods they roam
freely and there are added concerns like venomous
snakes rabid animals and no real paths to follow
but theres also food if you know how to find it my
father knew and he taught me some before he was
blown to bits in a mine explosion there was nothing
even to bury i was eleven then five years later i still
wake up screaming for him to run
even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and
poaching carries the severest of penalties more
people would risk it if they had weapons but most
are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife
my bow is a rarity crafted by my father along with a
few others that i keep well hidden in the woods
carefully wrapped in waterproof covers my father
could have made good money selling them but if the
officials found out he would have been publicly
executed for inciting a rebellion most of the
peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who
hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as
anybody is in fact theyre among our best
customers but the idea that someone might be
arming the seam would never have been allowed
in the fall a few brave souls sneak into the woods to
harvest apples but always in sight of the meadow
always close enough to run back to the safety of
district 12 if trouble arises district twelve where
you can starve to death in safety i mutter then i
glance quickly over my shoulder even here even in
the middle of nowhere you worry someone might
overhear you
when i was younger i scared my mother to death
the things i would blurt out about district 12 about

the people who rule our country panem from the far
off city called the capitol eventually i understood
this would only lead us to more trouble so i learned
to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an
indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my
thoughts do my work quietly in school make only
polite small talk in the public market discuss little
more than trades in the hob which is the black
market where i make most of my money even at
home where i am less pleasant i avoid discussing
tricky topics like the reaping or food shortages or
the hunger games prim might begin to repeat my
words and then where would we be
in the woods waits the only person with whom i can
be myself gale i can feel the muscles in my face
relaxing my pace quickening as i climb the hills to
our place a rock ledge overlooking a valley a thicket
of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes the
sight of him waiting there brings on a smile gale
says i never smile except in the woods
hey catnip says gale my real name is katniss
but when i first told him i had barely whispered it
so he thought id said catnip then when this crazy
lynx started following me around the woods looking
for handouts it became his official nickname for me i
finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off
game i almost regretted it because he wasnt bad
company but i got a decent price for his pelt
look what i shot gale holds up a loaf of bread with
an arrow stuck in it and i laugh its real bakery
bread not the flat dense loaves we make from our
grain rations i take it in my hands pull out the
arrow and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose
inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood
with saliva fine bread like this is for special
occasions

mm still warm i say he must have been at the
bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it what did
it cost you
just a squirrel think the old man was feeling
sentimental this morning says gale even wished
me luck
well we all feel a little closer today dont we i say
not even bothering to roll my eyes prim left us a
cheese i pull it out
his expression brightens at the treat thank you
prim well have a real feast suddenly he falls into a
capitol accent as he mimics effie trinket the
maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to
read out the names at the leaping i almost forgot
happy hunger games he plucks a few blackberries
from the bushes around us and may the odds —
he tosses a berry in a high arc toward me
i catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin
with my teeth the sweet tartness explodes across my
tongue  — be ever in your favor i finish with equal
verve we have to joke about it because the
alternative is to be scared out of your wits besides
the capitol accent is so affected almost anything
sounds funny in it
i watch as gale pulls out his knife and slices the
bread he could be my brother straight black hair
olive skin we even have the same gray eyes but were
not related at least not closely most of the families
who work the mines resemble one another this way
thats why my mother and prim with their light hair
and blue eyes always look out of place they are my
mothers parents were part of the small merchant
class that caters to officials peacekeepers and the

occasional seam customer they ran an apothecary
shop in the nicer part of district 12 since almost no
one can afford doctors apothecaries are our healers
my father got to know my mother because on his
hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs
and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies
she must have really loved him to leave her home for
the seam i try to remember that when all i can see is
the woman who sat by blank and unreachable while
her children turned to skin and bones i try to forgive
her for my fathers sake but to be honest im not the
forgiving type
gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat
cheese carefully placing a basil leaf on each while i
strip the bushes of their berries we settle back in a
nook in the rocks from this place we are invisible
but have a clear view of the valley which is teeming
with summer life greens to gather roots to dig fish
iridescent in the sunlight the day is glorious with a
blue sky and soft breeze the foods wonderful with
the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the
berries bursting in our mouths everything would be
perfect if this really was a holiday if all the day off
meant was roaming the mountains with gale
hunting for tonights supper but instead we have to
be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for
the names to be called out
we could do it you know gale says quietly
what i ask
leave the district run off live in the woods you
and i we could make it says gale
i dont know how to respond the idea is so
preposterous

if we didnt have so many kids he adds quickly
theyre not our kids of course but they might as well
be gales two little brothers and a sister prim and
you may as well throw in our mothers too because
how would they live without us who would fill those
mouths that are always asking for more with both of
us hunting daily there are still nights when game has
to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool still
nights when we go to bed with our stomachs
growling
i never want to have kids i say
i might if i didnt live here says gale
but you do i say irritated
forget it he snaps back
the conversation feels all wrong leave how could i
leave prim who is the only person in the world im
certain i love and gale is devoted to his family we
cant leave so why bother talking about it and even
if we did    even if we did    where did this stuff
about having kids come from theres never been
anything romantic between gale and me when we
met i was a skinny twelveyearold and although he
was only two years older he already looked like a
man it took a long time for us to even become
friends to stop haggling over every trade and begin
helping each other out
besides if he wants kids gale wont have any trouble
finding a wife hes goodlooking hes strong enough
to handle the work in the mines and he can hunt
you can tell by the way the girls whisper about him
when he walks by in school that they want him it

makes me jealous but not for the reason people would
think good hunting partners are hard to find
what do you want to do i ask we can hunt fish
or gather
lets fish at the lake we can leave our poles and
gather in the woods get something nice for tonight
he says
tonight after the reaping everyone is supposed to
celebrate and a lot of people do out of relief that
their children have been spared for another year but
at least two families will pull their shutters lock their
doors and try to figure out how they will survive the
painful weeks to come
we make out well the predators ignore us on a day
when easier tastier prey abounds by late morning
we have a dozen fish a bag of greens and best of all
a gallon of strawberries i found the patch a few years
ago but gale had the idea to string mesh nets around
it to keep out the animals
on the way home we swing by the hob the black
market that operates in an abandoned warehouse
that once held coal when they came up with a more
efficient system that transported the coal directly
from the mines to the trains the hob gradually took
over the space most businesses are closed by this
time on reaping day but the black markets still fairly
busy we easily trade six of the fish for good bread
the other two for salt greasy sae the bony old
woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large
kettle takes half the greens off our hands in
exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin we might
do a tad better elsewhere but we make an effort to
keep on good terms with greasy sae shes the only
one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild

dog we dont hunt them on purpose but if youre
attacked and you take out a dog or two well meat is
meat once its in the soup 111 call it beef greasy
sae says with a wink no one in the seam would turn
up their nose at a good leg of wild dog but the
peacekeepers who come to the hob can afford to be a
little choosier
when we finish our business at the market we go to
the back door of the mayors house to sell half the
strawberries knowing he has a particular fondness
for them and can afford our price the mayors
daughter madge opens the door shes in my year at
school being the mayors daughter youd expect her
to be a snob but shes all right she just keeps to
herself like me since neither of us really has a
group of friends we seem to end up together a lot at
school eating lunch sitting next to each other at
assemblies partnering for sports activities we rarely
talk which suits us both just fine
today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an
expensive white dress and her blonde hair is done up
with a pink ribbon reaping clothes
pretty dress says gale
madge shoots him a look trying to see if its a
genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic itisa
pretty dress but she would never be wearing it
ordinarily she presses her lips together and then
smiles well if i end up going to the capitol i want
to look nice dont i
now its gales turn to be confused does she mean
it or is she messing with him im guessing the
second

you wont be going to the capitol says gale coolly
his eyes land on a small circular pin that adorns her
dress real gold beautifully crafted it could keep a
family in bread for months what can you have five
entries i had six when i was just twelve years old
thats not her fault i say
no its no ones fault just the way it is says gale
madges face has become closed off she puts the
money for the berries in my hand good luck
katniss you too i say and the door closes
we walk toward the seam in silence i dont like that
gale took a dig at madge but hes right of course
the reaping system is unfair with the poor getting
the worst of it you become eligible for the reaping the
day you turn twelve that year your name is entered
once at thirteen twice and so on and so on until
you reach the age of eighteen the final year of
eligibility when your name goes into the pool seven
times thats true for every citizen in all twelve
districts in the entire country of panem
but heres the catch say you are poor and starving
as we were you can opt to add your name more times
in exchange for tesserae each tessera is worth a
meager years supply of grain and oil for one person
you may do this for each of your family members as
well so at the age of twelve i had my name entered
four times once because i had to and three times
for tesserae for grain and oil for myself prim and my
mother in fact every year i have needed to do this
and the entries are cumulative so now at the age of
sixteen my name will be in the reaping twenty times
gale who is eighteen and has been either helping or
singlehandedly feeding a family of five for seven
years will have his name in fortytwo times

you can see why someone like madge who has never
been at risk of needing a tessera can set him off the
chance of her name being drawn is very slim
compared to those of us who live in the seam not
impossible but slim and even though the rules were
set up by the capitol not the districts certainly not
madges family its hard not to resent those who dont
have to sign up for tesserae
gale knows his anger at madge is misdirected on
other days deep in the woods ive listened to him
rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to
cause misery in our district a way to plant hatred
between the starving workers of the seam and those
who can generally count on supper and thereby
ensure we will never trust one another its to the
capitols advantage to have us divided among
ourselves he might say if there were no ears to hear
but mine if it wasnt reaping day if a girl with a gold
pin and no tesserae had not made what im sure she
thought was a harmless comment
as we walk i glance over at gales face still
smoldering underneath his stony expression his
rages seem pointless to me although i never say so
its not that i dont agree with him i do but what
good is yelling about the capitol in the middle of the
woods it doesnt change anything it doesnt make
things fair it doesnt fill our stomachs in fact it
scares off the nearby game i let him yell though
better he does it in the woods than in the district
gale and i divide our spoils leaving two fish a couple
of loaves of good bread greens a quart of
strawberries salt paraffin and a bit of money for
each
see you in the square i say

wear something pretty he says flatly
at home i find my mother and sister are ready to go
my mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary
days prim is in my first reaping outfit a skirt and
ruffled blouse its a bit big on her but my mother
has made it stay with pins even so shes having
trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back
a tub of warm water waits for me i scrub off the dirt
and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair to
my surprise my mother has laid out one of her own
lovely dresses for me a soft blue thing with matching
shoes
are you sure i ask im trying to get past rejecting
offers of help from her for a while i was so angry i
wouldnt allow her to do anything for me and this is
something special her clothes from her past are very
precious to her
of course lets put your hair up too she says i let
her toweldry it and braid it up on my head i can
hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that
leans against the wall
you look beautiful says prim in a hushed voice
and nothing like myself i say i hug her because i
know these next few hours will be terrible for her her
first reaping shes about as safe as you can get since
shes only entered once i wouldnt let her take out
any tesserae but shes worried about me that the
unthinkable might happen
i protect prim in every way i can but im powerless
against the reaping the anguish i always feel when
shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to
register on my ace i notice her blouse has pulled out

of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay
calm tuck your tail in little duck i say smoothing
the blouse back in place
prim giggles and gives me a smallquack
quack yourself i say with a light laugh the kind
only prim can draw out of me come on lets eat i
say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head
the fish and greens are already cooking in a stew but
that will be for supper we decide to save the
strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal
to make it special we say instead we drink milk from
prims goat lady and eat the rough bread made from
the tessera grain although no one has much appetite
anyway
at one oclock we head for the square attendance is
mandatory unless you are on deaths door this
evening officials will come around and check to see if
this is the case if not youll be imprisoned
its too bad really that they hold the reaping in the
square — one of the few places in district 12 that can
be pleasant the squares surrounded by shops and
on public market days especially if theres good
weather it has a holiday feel to it but today despite
the bright banners hanging on the buildings theres
an air of grimness the camera crews perched like
buzzards on rooftops only add to the effect
people file in silently and sign in the reaping is a
good opportunity for the capitol to keep tabs on the
population as well twelve through eighteenyear
olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages
the oldest in the front the young ones like prim
toward the back family members line up around the
perimeter holding tightly to one anothers hands but

there are others too who have no one they love at
stake or who no longer care who slip among the
crowd taking bets on the two kids whose names will
be drawn odds are given on their ages whether
theyre seam or merchant if they will break down and
weep most refuse dealing with the racketeers but
carefully carefully these same people tend to be
informers and who hasnt broken the law i could be
shot on a daily basis for hunting but the appetites of
those in charge protect me not everyone can claim
the same
anyway gale and i agree that if we have to choose
between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head the
bullet would be much quicker
the space gets tighter more claustrophobic as people
arrive the squares quite large but not enough to
hold district 12s population of about eight thousand
latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where
they can watch the event on screens as its televised
live by the state
i find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the
seam we all exchange terse nods then focus our
attention on the temporary stage that is set up before
the justice building it holds three chairs a podium
and two large glass balls one for the boys and one for
the girls i stare at the paper slips in the girls ball
twenty of them have katniss everdeen written on
them in careful handwriting
two of the three chairs fill with madges father mayor
undersee whos a tall balding man and effie
trinket district 12s escort fresh from the capitol
with her scary white grin pinkish hair and spring
green suit they murmur to each other and then look
with concern at the empty seat

just as the town clock strikes two the mayor steps
up to the podium and begins to read its the same
story every year he tells of the history of panem the
country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that
was once called north america he lists the disasters
the droughts the storms the fires the encroaching
seas that swallowed up so much of the land the
brutal war for what little sustenance remained the
result was panem a shining capitol ringed by
thirteen districts which brought peace and prosperity
to its citizens then came the dark days the uprising
of the districts against the capitol twelve were
defeated the thirteenth obliterated the treaty of
treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace
and as our yearly reminder that the dark days must
never be repeated it gave us the hunger games
the rules of the hunger games are simple in
punishment for the uprising each of the twelve
districts must provide one girl and one boy called
tributes to participate the twentyfour tributes will
be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold
anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland
over a period of several weeks the competitors must
fight to the death the last tribute standing wins
taking the kids from our districts forcing them to kill
one another while we watch — this is the capitols
way of reminding us how totally we are at their
mercy how little chance we would stand of surviving
another rebellion
whatever words they use the real message is
clear look how we take your children and sacrifice
them and theres nothing you can do if you lift a
finger we will destroy every last one of you just as
we did in district thirteen

to make it humiliating as well as torturous the
capitol requires us to treat the hunger games as a
festivity a sporting event pitting every district against
the others the last tribute alive receives a life of ease
back home and their district will be showered with
prizes largely consisting of food all year the capitol
will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil
and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us
battle starvation
it is both a time for repentance and a time for
thanks intones the mayor
then he reads the list of past district 12 victors in
seventyfour years we have had exactly two only one
is still alive haymitch abernathy a paunchy middle
aged man who at this moment appears hollering
something unintelligible staggers onto the stage and
falls into the third chair hes drunk very the crowd
responds with its token applause but hes confused
and tries to give effie trinket a big hug which she
barely manages to fend off
the mayor looks distressed since all of this is being
televised right now district 12 is the laughingstock of
panem and he knows it he quickly tries to pull the
attention back to the reaping by introducing effie
trinket
bright and bubbly as ever effie trinket trots to the
podium and gives her signature happy hunger
games and may the odds be ever in your favor her
pink hair must be a wig because her curls have
shifted slightly offcenter since her encounter with
haymitch she goes on a bit about what an honor it is
to be here although everyone knows shes just aching
to get bumped up to a better district where they have
proper victors not drunks who molest you in front of
the entire nation

through the crowd i spot gale looking back at me
with a ghost of a smile as reapings go this one at
least has a slight entertainment factor but suddenly i
am thinking of gale and his fortytwo names in that
big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor
not compared to a lot of the boys and maybe hes
thinking the same thing about me because his face
darkens and he turns away but there are still
thousands of slips i wish i could whisper to him
its time for the drawing effie trinket says as she
always does ladies firstand crosses to the glass
ball with the girls names she reaches in digs her
hand deep into the ball and pulls out a slip of paper
the crowd draws in a collective breath and then you
can hear a pin drop and im feeling nauseous and so
desperately hoping that its not me that its not me
that its not me
effie trinket crosses back to the podium smoothes
the slip of paper and reads out the name in a clear
voice and its not me
its primrose everdeen

one time when i was in a blind in a tree waiting
motionless for game to wander by i dozed off and fell
ten feet to the ground landing on my back it was as
if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my
lungs and i lay there struggling to inhale to exhale
to do anything
thats how i feel now trying to remember how to
breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name
bounces around the inside of my skull someone is
gripping my arm a boy from the seam and i think
maybe i started to fall and he caught me
there must have been some mistake this cant be
happening prim was one slip of paper in thousands
her chances of being chosen so remote that id not
even bothered to worry about her hadnt i done
everything taken the tesserae refused to let her do
the same one slip one slip in thousands the odds
had been entirely in her favor but it hadnt mattered
somewhere far away i can hear the crowd
murmuring unhappily as they always do when a
twelveyearold gets chosen because no one thinks
this is fair and then i see her the blood drained from
her face hands clenched in fists at her sides walking
with stiff small steps up toward the stage passing
me and i see the back of her blouse has become
untucked and hangs out over her skirt its this
detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that
brings me back to myself
prim the strangled cry comes out of my throat and
my muscles begin to move again prim i dont need

to shove through the crowd the other kids make way
immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage
i reach her just as she is about to mount the steps
with one sweep of my arm i push her behind me
i volunteer i gasp i volunteer as tribute
theres some confusion on the stage district 12
hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol
has become rusty the rule is that once a tributes
name has been pulled from the ball another eligible
boy if a boys name has been read or girl if a girls
name has been read can step forward to take his or
her place in some districts in which winning the
reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk
their lives the volunteering is complicated but in
district 12 where the wordtribute is pretty much
synonymous with the word corpse volunteers are all
but extinct
lovely says effie trinket but i believe theres a
small matter of introducing the reaping winner and
then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth
then we um  she trails off unsure herself
what does it matter says the mayor hes looking
at me with a pained expression on his face he
doesnt know me really but theres a faint recognition
there i am the girl who brings the strawberries the
girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion
the girl who five years ago stood huddled with her
mother and sister as he presented her the oldest
child with a medal of valor a medal for her father
vaporized in the mines does he remember that
what does it matter he repeats gruffly let her
come forward

prim is screaming hysterically behind me shes
wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice no
katniss no you cant go
prim let go i say harshly because this is upsetting
me and i dont want to cry when they televise the
replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make
note of my tears and ill be marked as an easy target
a weakling i will give no one that satisfaction let
go
i can feel someone pulling her from my back i turn
and see gale has lifted prim off the ground and shes
thrashing in his arms up you go catnip he says
in a voice hes fighting to keep steady and then he
carries prim off toward my mother i steel myself and
climb the steps
well bravo gushes effie trinket thats the spirit
of the games shes pleased to finally have a district
with a little action going on in it whats your name
i swallow hard katniss everdeen i say
i bet my buttons that was your sister dont want her
to steal all the glory do we come on everybody
lets give a big round of applause to our newest
tribute trills effie trinket
to the everlasting credit of the people of district 12
not one person claps not even the ones holding
betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring
possibly because they know me from the hob or
knew my father or have encountered prim who no
one can help loving so instead of acknowledging
applause i stand there unmoving while they take part
in the boldest form of dissent they can manage
silence which says we do not agree we do not
condone all of this is wrong

then something unexpected happens at least i dont
expect it because i dont think of district 12 as a
place that cares about me but a shift has occurred
since i stepped up to take prims place and now it
seems i have become someone precious at first one
then another then almost every member of the crowd
touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to
their lips and holds it out to me it is an old and
rarely used gesture of our district occasionally seen
at funerals it means thanks it means admiration it
means goodbye to someone you love
now i am truly in danger of crying but fortunately
haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across
the stage to congratulate me look at her look at
this one he hollers throwing an arm around my
shoulders hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck
i like her his breath reeks of liquor and its been a
long time since hes bathed lots of  he cant
think of the word for a while spunk he says
triumphantly more than you he releases me and
starts for the front of the stage more than you he
shouts pointing directly into a camera
is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he
might actually be taunting the capitol ill never
know because just as hes opening his mouth to
continue haymitch plummets off the stage and
knocks himself unconscious
hes disgusting but im grateful with every camera
gleefully trained on him i have just enough time to
release the small choked sound in my throat and
compose myself i put my hands behind my back and
stare into the distance
i can see the hills i climbed this morning with gale
for a moment i yearn for something    the idea of us
leaving the district    making our way in the woods

but i know i was right about not running off because
who else would have volunteered for prim
haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and effie
trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again what an
exciting day she warbles as she attempts to
straighten her wig which has listed severely to the
right but more excitement to come its time to
choose our boy tribute clearly hoping to contain her
tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her
head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys
names and grabs the first slip she encounters she
zips back to the podium and i dont even have time to
wish for gales safety when shes reading the name
peeta mellark
peeta mellark
oh no i think not him because i recognize this
name although i have never spoken directly to its
owner peeta mellark
no the odds are not in my favor today i watch him
as he makes his way toward the stage medium
height stocky build ashy blond hair that falls in
waves over
his forehead the shock of the moment is registering
on his face you can see his struggle to remain
emotionless but his blue eyes show the alarm ive
seen so often in prey yet he climbs steadily onto the
stage and takes his place
effie trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps
forward he has two older brothers i know ive seen
them in the bakery but one is probably too old now
to volunteer and the other wont this is standard
family devotion only goes so far for most people on
reaping day what i did was the radical thing

the mayor begins to read the long dull treaty of
treason as he does every year at this point — its
required — but im not listening to a word
why him i think then i try to convince myself it
doesnt matter peeta mellark and i are not friends
not even neighbors we dont speak our only real
interaction happened years ago hes probably
forgotten it but i havent and i know i never will
it was during the worst time my father had been
killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the
bitterest january anyone could remember the
numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would
hit me out of nowhere doubling me over racking my
body with sobs where are you i would cry out in my
mind where have you gone of course there was
never any answer
the district had given us a small amount of money as
compensation for his death enough to cover one
month of grieving at which time my mother would be
expected to get a job only she didnt she didnt do
anything but sit propped up in a chair or more often
huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on
some point in the distance once in a while shed
stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only
to then collapse back into stillness no amount of
pleading from prim seemed to affect her
i was terrified i suppose now that my mother was
locked in some dark world of sadness but at the
time all i knew was that i had lost not only a father
but a mother as well at eleven years old with prim
just seven i took over as head of the family there
was no choice i bought our food at the market and
cooked it as best i could and tried to keep prim and
myself looking presentable because if it had become
known that my mother could no longer care for us

the district would have taken us away from her and
placed us in the community home id grown up
seeing those home kids at school the sadness the
marks of angry hands on their faces the
hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward i
could never let that happen to prim sweet tiny prim
who cried when i cried before she even knew the
reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair
before we left for school who still polished my fathers
shaving mirror each night because hed hated the
layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the
seam the community home would crush her like a
bug so i kept our predicament a secret
but the money ran out and we were slowly starving to
death theres no other way to put it i kept telling
myself if i could only hold out until may just may
8th i would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the
tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed
us only there were still several weeks to go we could
well be dead by then
starvations not an uncommon fate in district 12
who hasnt seen the victims older people who cant
work children from a family with too many to feed
those injured in the mines straggling through the
streets and one day you come upon them sitting
motionless against a wall or lying in the meadow you
hear the wails from a house and the peacekeepers
are called in to retrieve the body starvation is never
the cause of death officially its always the flu or
exposure or pneumonia but that fools no one
on the afternoon of my encounter with peeta mellark
the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets i had
been in town trying to trade some threadbare old
baby clothes of prims in the public market but there
were no takers although i had been to the hob on
several occasions with my father i was too frightened

to venture into that rough gritty place alone the rain
had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket
leaving me chilled to the bone for three days wed
had nothing but boiled water with some old dried
mint leaves id found in the back of a cupboard by
the time the market closed i was shaking so hard i
dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle
i didnt pick it up for fear i would keel over and be
unable to regain my feet besides no one wanted
those clothes
i couldnt go home because at home was my mother
with her dead eyes and my little sister with her
hollow cheeks and cracked lips i couldnt walk into
that room with the smoky fire from the damp
branches i had scavenged at the edge of the woods
after the coal had run out my bands empty of any
hope
i found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind
the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople the
merchants live above their businesses so i was
essentially in their backyards i remember the
outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring
a goat or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post
hunched defeated in the muck
all forms of stealing are forbidden in district 12
punishable by death but it crossed my mind that
there might be something in the trash bins and those
were fair game perhaps a bone at the butchers or
rotted vegetables at the grocers something no one
but my family was desperate enough to eat
unfortunately the bins had just been emptied
when i passed the bakers the smell of fresh bread
was so overwhelming i felt dizzy the ovens were in
the back and a golden glow spilled out the open
kitchen door i stood mesmerized by the heat and the

luscious scent until the rain interfered running its
icy fingers down my back forcing me back to life i
lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it
spotlessly heartlessly bare
suddenly a voice was screaming at me and i looked
up to see the bakers wife telling me to move on and
did i want her to call the peacekeepers and how sick
she was of having those brats from the seam pawing
through her trash the words were ugly and i had no
defense as i carefully replaced the lid and backed
away i noticed him a boy with blond hair peering out
from behind his mothers back id seen him at
school he was in my year but i didnt know his
name he stuck with the town kids so how would i
his mother went back into the bakery grumbling but
he must have been watching me as i made my way
behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against
the far side of an old apple tree the realization that
id have nothing to take home had finally sunk in my
knees buckled and i slid down the tree trunk to its
roots it was too much i was too sick and weak and
tired oh so tired let them call the peacekeepers and
take us to the community home i thought or better
yet let me die right here in the rain
there was a clatter in the bakery and i heard the
woman screaming again and the sound of a blow and
i vaguely wondered what was going on feet sloshed
toward me through the mud and i thought its her
shes coming to drive me away with a stick but it
wasnt her it was the boy in his arms he carried two
large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the
fire because the crusts were scorched black
his mother was yelling feed it to the pig you stupid
creature why not no one decent will buy burned
bread

he began to tear off chunks from the burned parts
and toss them into the trough and the front bakery
bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a
customer
the boy never even glanced my way but i was
watching him because of the bread because of the
red weal that stood out on his cheekbone what had
she hit him with
my parents never hit us i couldnt even imagine it
the boy took one look back to the bakery as if
checking that the coast was clear then his attention
back on the pig he threw a loaf of bread in my
direction the second quickly followed and he
sloshed back to the bakery closing the kitchen door
tightly behind him
i stared at the loaves in disbelief they were fine
perfect really except for the burned areas did he
mean for me to have them he must have because
there they were at my feet before anyone could
witness what had happened i shoved the loaves up
under my shirt wrapped the hunting jacket tightly
about me and walked swiftly away the heat of the
bread burned into my skin but i clutched it tighter
clinging to life
by the time i reached home the loaves had cooled
somewhat but the insides were still warm when i
dropped them on the table prims hands reached to
tear off a chunk but i made her sit forced my mother
to join us at the table and poured warm tea i
scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread we
ate an entire loaf slice by slice it was good hearty
bread filled with raisins and nuts
i put my clothes to dry at the fire crawled into bed
and fell into a dreamless sleep it didnt occur to me

until the next morning that the boy might have
burned the bread on purpose might have dropped
the loaves into the flames knowing it meant being
punished and then delivered them to me but i
dismissed this it must have been an accident why
would he have done it he didnt even know me still
just throwing me the bread was an enormous
kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating
if discovered 1 couldnt explain his actions
we ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to
school it was as if spring had come overnight warm
sweet air fluffy clouds at school i passed the boy in
the hall his cheek had swelled up and his eye had
blackened he was with his friends and didnt
acknowledge me in any way but as i collected prim
and started for home that afternoon i found him
staring at me from across the school yard our eyes
met for only a second then he turned his head away
i dropped my gaze embarrassed and thats when i
saw it the first dandelion of the year a bell went off
in my head i thought of the hours spent in the woods
with my father and i knew how we were going to
survive
to this day i can never shake the connection between
this boy peeta mellark and the bread that gave me
hope and the dandelion that reminded me that i was
not doomed and more than once i have turned in
the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on
me only to quickly flit away i feel like i owe him
something and i hate owing people maybe if i had
thanked him at some point id be feeling less
conflicted now i thought about it a couple of times
but the opportunity never seemed to present itself
and now it never will because were going to be
thrown into an arena to fight to the death exactly
how am i supposed to work in a thankyou in there

somehow it just wont seem sincere if im trying to slit
his throat
the mayor finishes the dreary treaty of treason and
motions for peeta and me to shake hands his are as
solid and warm as those loaves of bread peeta looks
me right in the eye and gives my hand what i think is
meant to be a reassuring squeeze maybe its just a
nervous spasm
we turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of
panem plays
oh well i think there will be twentyfour of us odds
are someone else will kill him before i do
of course the odds have not been very dependable of
late

the moment the anthem ends we are taken into
custody i dont mean were handcuffed or anything
but a group of peacekeepers marches us through the
front door of the justice building maybe tributes
have tried to escape in the past ive never seen that
happen though
once inside im conducted to a room and left alone
its the richest place ive ever been in with thick deep
carpets and a velvet couch and chairs i know velvet
because my mother has a dress with a collar made of
the stuff when i sit on the couch i cant help
running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly it helps
to calm me as i try to prepare for the next hour the
time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their
loved ones i cannot afford to get upset to leave this
room with puffy eyes and a red nose crying is not an
option there will be more cameras at the train
station
my sister and my mother come first i reach out to
prim and she climbs on my lap her arms around my
neck head on my shoulder just like she did when
she was a toddler my mother sits beside me and
wraps her arms around us for a few minutes we say
nothing then i start telling them all the things they
must remember to do now that i will not be there to
do them for them
prim is not to take any tesserae they can get by if
theyre careful on selling prims goat milk and cheese
and the small apothecary business my mother now
runs for the people in the seam gale will get her the
herbs she doesnt grow herself but she must be very

careful to describe them because hes not as familiar
with them as i am hell also bring them game — he
and i made a pact about this a year or so ago — and
will probably not ask for compensation but they
should thank him with some kind of trade like milk
or medicine
i dont bother suggesting prim learn to hunt i tried to
teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous the
woods terrified her and whenever i shot something
shed get teary and talk about how we might be able
to heal it if we got it home soon enough but she
makes out well with her goat so i concentrate on
that
when i am done with instructions about fuel and
trading and staying in school i turn to my mother
and grip her arm hard listen to me are you
listening to me she nods alarmed by my intensity
she must know whats coming you cant leave
again i say
my mothers eyes find the floor i know i wont i
couldnt help what —
well you have to help it this time you cant clock
out and leave prim on her own theres no me now to
keep you both alive it doesnt matter what happens
whatever you see on the screen you have to promise
me youll fight through it my voice has risen to a
shout in it is all the anger all the fear i felt at her
abandonment
she pulls her arm from my grasp moved to anger
herself now i was ill i could have treated myself if
id had the medicine i have now
that part about her being ill might be true ive seen
her bring back people suffering from immobilizing

sadness since perhaps it is a sickness but its one
we cant afford
then take it and take care of her i say
ill be all right katniss says prim clasping my face
in her hands but you have to take care too youre
so fast and brave maybe you can win
i cant win prim must know that in her heart the
competition will be far beyond my abilities kids from
wealthier districts where winning is a huge honor
whove been trained their whole lives for this boys
who are two to three times my size girls who know
twenty different ways to kill you with a knife oh
thereh be people like me too people to weed out
before the real fun begins
maybe i say because i can hardly tell my mother to
carry on if ive already given up myself besides it
isnt in my nature to go down without a fight even
when things seem insurmountable then wed be
rich as haymitch
i dont care if were rich i just want you to come
home you will try wont you really really try asks
prim
really really try i swear it i say and i know
because of prim ill have to
and then the peacekeeper is at the door signaling our
time is up and were all hugging one another so hard
it hurts and all im saying is i love you i love you
both and theyre saying it back and then the
peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes i
bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this
can block the whole thing out

someone else enters the room and when i look up
im surprised to see its the baker peeta mellarks
father i cant believe hes come to visit me after all
ill be trying to kill his son soon but we do know each
other a bit and he knows prim even better when she
sells her goat cheeses at the hob she puts two of
them aside for him and he gives her a generous
amount of bread in return we always wait to trade
with him when his witch of a wife isnt around
because hes so much nicer i feel certain he would
never have hit his son the way she did over the
burned bread but why has he come to see me
the baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the
plush chairs hes a big broadshouldered man with
burn scars from years at the ovens he must have
just said goodbye to his son
he pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket
and holds it out to me i open it and find cookies
these are a luxury we can never afford
thank you i say the bakers not a very talkative
man in the best of times and today he has no words
at all i had some of your bread this morning my
friend gale gave you a squirrel for it he nods as if
remembering the squirrel not your best trade i say
he shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter
then i cant think of anything else so we sit in silence
until a peacemaker summons him he rises and
coughs to clear his throat ill keep an eye on the
little girl make sure shes eating
i feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his
words people deal with me but they are genuinely
fond of prim maybe there will be enough fondness to
keep her alive

my next guest is also unexpected madge walks
straight to me she is not weepy or evasive instead
theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me
they let you wear one thing from your district in the
arena one thing to remind you of home will you
wear this she holds out the circular gold pin that
was on her dress earlier i hadnt paid much attention
to it before but now i see its a small bird in flight
your pin i say wearing a token from my district is
about the last thing on my mind
here ill put it on your dress all right madge
doesnt wait for an answer she just leans in and fixes
the bird to my dress promise youll wear it into the
arena katniss she asks promise
yes i say cookies a pin im getting all kinds of
gifts today madge gives me one more a kiss on the
cheek then shes gone and im left thinking that
maybe madge really has been my friend all along
finally gale is here and maybe there is nothing
romantic between us but when he opens his arms i
dont hesitate to go into them his body is familiar to
me — the way it moves the smell of wood smoke
even the sound of his heart beating i know from quiet
moments on a hunt — but this is the first time i
really feel it lean and hardmuscled against my own
listen he says getting a knife should be pretty
easy but youve got to get your hands on a bow
thats your best chance
they dont always have bows i say thinking of the
year there were only horrible spiked maces that the
tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with

then make one says gale even a weak bow is
better than no bow at all
i have tried copying my fathers bows with poor
results its not that easy even he had to scrap his
own work sometimes
i dont even know if therell be wood i say another
year they tossed everybody into a landscape of
nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes i
particularly hated that year many contestants were
bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from
thirst
theres almost always some wood gale says since
that year half of them died of cold not much
entertainment in that
its true we spent one hunger games watching the
players freeze to death at night you could hardly see
them because they were just huddled in balls and
had no wood for fires or torches or anything it was
considered very anticlimactic in the capitol all those
quiet bloodless deaths since then theres usually
been wood to make fires
yes theres usually some i say
katniss its just hunting youre the best hunter i
know says gale
its not just hunting theyre armed they think i
say
so do you and youve had more practice real
practice he says you know how to kill
not people i say

how different can it be really says gale grimly
the awful thing is that if i can forget theyre people it
will be no different at all
the peacekeepers are back too soon and gale asks for
more time but theyre taking him away and i start to
panic dont let them starve i cry out clinging to
his hand
i wont you know i wont katniss remember i —  he
says and they yank us apart and slam the door and
111 never know what it was he wanted me to
remember
its a short ride from the justice building to the train
station ive never been in a car before rarely even
ridden in wagons in the seam we travel on foot
ive been right not to cry the station is swarming
with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained
directly on my face but ive had a lot of practice at
wiping my face clean of emotions and i do this now i
catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on
the wall thats airing my arrival live and feel gratified
that i appear almost bored
peeta mellark on the other hand has obviously been
crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be
trying to cover it up i immediately wonder if this will
be his strategy in the games to appear weak and
frightened to reassure the other tributes that he is no
competition at all and then come out fighting this
worked very well for a girl johanna mason from
district 7 a few years back she seemed like such a
sniveling cowardly fool that no one bothered about
her until there were only a handful of contestants left
it turned out she could kill viciously pretty clever the
way she played it but this seems an odd strategy for

peeta mellark because hes a bakers son all those
years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays
around have made him broadshouldered and strong
it will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone
to overlook him
we have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of
the train while the cameras gobble up our images
then were allowed inside and the doors close
mercifully behind us the train begins to move at
once
the speed initially takes my breath away of course
ive never been on a train as travel between the
districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned
duties for us thats mainly transporting coal but
this is no ordinary coal train its one of the high
speed capitol models that average 250 miles per
hour our journey to the capitol will take less than a
day
in school they tell us the capitol was built in a place
once called the rockies district 12 was in a region
known is appalachia even hundreds of years ago
they mined coal here which is why our miners have
to dig so deep
somehow it all comes back to coal at school besides
basic reading and math most of our instruction is
coalrelated except for the weekly lecture on the
history of panem its mostly a lot of blather about
what we owe the capitol i know there must be more
than theyre telling us an actual account of what
happened during the rebellion but i dont spend
much time thinking about it whatever the truth is i
dont see how it will help me get food on the table
the tribute train is fancier than even the room in the
justice building we are each given our own

chambers that have a bedroom a dressing area and
a private bathroom with hot and cold running water
we dont have hot water at home unless we boil it
there are drawers filled with fine clothes and effie
trinket tells me to do anything i want wear anything
i want everything is at my disposal just be ready for
supper in an hour i peel off my mothers blue dress
and take a hot shower ive never had a shower
before its like being in a summer rain only warmer
i dress in a dark green shirt and pants
at the last minute i remember madges little gold pin
for the first time i get a good look at it its as if
someone fashioned a small golden bird and then
attached a ring around it the bird is connected to the
ring only by its wing tips i suddenly recognize it a
mockingj ay
theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the
face to the capitol during the rebellion the capitol
bred a series of genetically altered animals as
weapons the common term for them was muttations
or sometimesmuttsfor short one was a special bird
called a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize
and repeat whole human conversations they were
homing birds exclusively male that were released
into regions where the capitols enemies were known
to be hiding after the birds gathered words theyd fly
back to centers to be recorded it took people awhile
to realize what was going on in the districts how
private conversations were being transmitted then
of course the rebels fed the capitol endless lies and
the joke was on it so the centers were shut down and
the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild
only they didnt die off instead the jabberjays mated
with female mockingbirds creating a whole new
species that could replicate both bird whistles and

human melodies they had lost the ability to
enunciate words but could still mimic a range of
human vocal sounds from a childs highpitched
warble to a mans deep tones and they could re
create songs not just a few notes but whole songs
with multiple verses if you had the patience to sing
them and if they liked your voice
my father was particularly fond of mockingjays when
we went hunting he would whistle or sing
complicated songs to them and after a polite pause
theyd always sing back not everyone is treated with
such respect but whenever my father sang all the
birds in the area would fall silent and listen his voice
was that beautiful high and clear and so filled with
life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same
time i could never bring myself to continue the
practice after he was gone still theres something
comforting about the little bird its like having a piece
of my father with me protecting me i fasten the pin
onto my shirt and with the dark green fabric as a
background i can almost imagine the mockingjay
flying through the trees
effie trinket comes to collect me for supper i follow
her through the narrow rocking corridor into a dining
room with polished paneled walls theres a table
where all the dishes are highly breakable peeta
mellark sits waiting for us the chair next to him
empty
wheres haymitch asks effie trinket brightly
last time i saw him he said he was going to take a
nap says peeta
well its been an exhausting day says effie trinket
i think shes relieved by haymitch s absence and who
can blame her

the supper comes in courses a thick carrot soup
green salad lamb chops and mashed potatoes cheese
and fruit a chocolate cake throughout the meal
effie trinket keeps reminding us to save space
because theres more to come but im stuffing myself
because ive never had food like this so good and so
much and because probably the best thing i can do
between now and the games is put on a few pounds
at least you two have decent manners says effie as
were finishing the main course the pair last year
ate everything with their hands like a couple of
savages it completely upset my digestion
the pair last year were two kids from the seam whod
never not one day of their lives had enough to eat
and when they did have food table manners were
surely the last thing on their minds peetas a bakers
son my mother taught prim and i to eat properly so
yes i can handle a fork and knife but i hate effie
trinkets comment so much i make a point of eating
the rest of my meal with my fingers then i wipe my
hands on the tablecloth this makes her purse her
lips tightly together
now that the meals over im fighting to keep the food
down i can see peetas looking a little green too
neither of our stomachs is used to such rich fare but
if i can hold down greasy saes concoction of mice
meat pig entrails and tree bark — a winter specialty
— im determined to hang on to this
we go to another compartment to watch the recap of
the reapings across panem they try to stagger them
throughout the day so a person could conceivably
watch the whole thing live but only people in the
capitol could really do that since none of them have
to attend reapings themselves

one by one we see the other reapings the names
called the volunteers stepping forward or more
often not we examine the faces of the kids who will
be our competition a few stand out in my mind a
monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from
district 2 a foxfaced girl with sleek red hair from
district 5 a boy with a crippled foot from district 10
and most hauntingly a twelveyearold girl from
district 1 1  she has dark brown skin and eyes but
other than that shes very like prim in size and
demeanor only when she mounts the stage and they
ask for volunteers all you can hear is the wind
whistling through the decrepit buildings around her
theres no one willing to take her place
last of all they show district 12 prim being called
me running forward to volunteer you cant miss the
desperation in my voice as i shove prim behind me as
if im afraid no one will hear and they 11 take prim
away but of course they do hear i see gale pulling
her off me and watch myself mount the stage the
commentators are not sure what to say about the
crowds refusal to applaud the silent salute one
says that district 12 has always been a bit backward
but that local customs can be charming as if on cue
haymitch falls off the stage and they groan comically
peetas name is drawn and he quietly takes his place
we shake hands they cut to the anthem again and
the program ends
effie trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig
was in your mentor has a lot to learn about
presentation a lot about televised behavior
peeta unexpectedly laughs he was drunk says
peetahes drunk every year
every day i add i cant help smirking a little effie
trinket makes it sound like haymitch just has

somewhat rough manners that could be corrected
with a few tips from her
yes hisses effie trinket how odd you two find it
amusing you know your mentor is your lifeline to the
world in these games the one who advises you lines
up your sponsors and dictates the presentation of
any gifts haymitch can well be the difference between
your life and your death
just then haymitch staggers into the compartment
i miss supper he says in a slurred voice then he
vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the
mess
so laugh away says effie trinket she hops in her
pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the
room

for a few moments peeta and i take in the scene of
our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff
from his stomach the reek of vomit and raw spirits
almost brings my dinner up we exchange a glance
obviously haymitch isnt much but effie trinket is
right about one thing once were in the arena hes all
weve got as if by some unspoken agreement peeta
and i each take one of haymitch s arms and help him
to his feet
i tripped haymitch asks smells bad he wipes
his hand on his nose smearing his face with vomit
lets get you back to your room says peeta clean
you up a bit
we halflead halfcarry haymitch back to his
compartment since we cant exactly set him down on
the embroidered bedspread we haul him into the
bathtub and turn the shower on him he hardly
notices
its okay peeta says to me ill take it from here
i cant help feeling a little grateful since the last thing
i want to do is strip down haymitch wash the vomit
out of his chest hair and tuck him into bed possibly
peeta is trying to make a good impression on him to
be his favorite once the games begin but judging by
the state hes in haymitch will have no memory of
this tomorrow
all right i say i can send one of the capitol people
to help you theres any number on the train

cooking lor us waiting on us guarding us taking
care of us is their job
no i dont want them says peeta
i nod and head to my own room i understand how
peeta feels i cant stand the sight of the capitol
people myself but making them deal with haymitch
might be a small form of revenge so im pondering
the reason why he insists on taking care of haymitch
and all of a sudden i think its because hes being
kind just as he was kind to give me the bread
the idea pulls me up short a kind peeta mellark is
far more dangerous to me than an unkind one kind
people have a way of working their way inside me and
rooting there and i cant let peeta do this not where
were going so i decide from this moment on to have
as little as possible to do with the bakers son
when i get back to my room the train is pausing at a
platform to refuel i quickly open the window toss the
cookies peetas father gave me out of the train and
slam the glass shut no more no more of either of
them
unfortunately the packet of cookies hits the ground
and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the
track i only see the image for a moment because the
train is off again but its enough enough to remind
me of that other dandelion in the school yard years
ago
i had just turned away from peeta mellarks bruised
face when i saw the dandelion and i knew hope
wasnt lost i plucked it carefully and hurried home i
grabbed a bucket and prims hand and headed to the
meadow and yes it was dotted with the golden
headed weeds after wed harvested those we

scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile
until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens
stems and flowers that night we gorged ourselves
on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread
what else prim asked me what other food can we
find
all kinds of things i promised her i just have to
remember them
my mother had a book shed brought with her from
the apothecary shop the pages were made of old
parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants
neat handwritten blocks told their names where to
gather them when they came in bloom their medical
uses but my father added other entries to the book
plants for eating not healing dandelions pokeweed
wild onions pines prim and i spent the rest of the
night poring over those pages
the next day we were off school for a while i hung
around the edges of the meadow but finally i worked
up the courage to go under the fence it was the first
time id been there alone without my fathers
weapons to protect me but i retrieved the small bow
and arrows hed made me from a hollow tree i
probably didnt go more than twenty yards into the
woods that day most of the time i perched up in the
branches of an old oak hoping for game to come by
after several hours i had the good luck to kill a
rabbit
id shot a few rabbits before with my fathers
guidance but this id done on my own
we hadnt had meat in months the sight of the
rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother she
roused herself skinned the carcass and made a stew

with the meat and some more greens prim had
gathered then she acted confused and went back to
bed but when the stew was done we made her eat a
bowl
the woods became our savior and each day i went a
bit farther into its arms it was slowgoing at first but
i was determined to feed us i stole eggs from nests
caught fish in nets sometimes managed to shoot a
squirrel or rabbit for stew and gathered the various
plants that sprung up beneath my feet plants are
tricky many are edible but one false mouthful and
youre dead i checked and doublechecked the plants
i harvested with my fathers pictures i kept us alive
any sign of danger a distant howl the inexplicable
break of a branch sent me flying back to the fence at
first then i began to risk climbing trees to escape the
wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on bears
and cats lived deeper in perhaps disliking the sooty
reek of our district
on may 8th i went to the justice building signed up
for my tesserae and pulled home my first batch of
grain and oil in prims toy wagon on the eighth of
every month i wasentitled to do the same i couldnt
stop hunting and gathering of course the grain was
not enough to live on and there were other things to
buy soap and milk and thread what we didnt
absolutely have to eat i began to trade at the hob it
was frightening to enter that place without my father
at my side but people had respected him and they
accepted me game was game after all no matter
whod shot it i also sold at the back doors of the
wealthier clients in town trying to remember what my
father had told me and learning a few new tricks as
well the butcher would buy my rabbits but not
squirrels the baker enjoyed squirrel but would only
trade for one if his wife wasnt around the head

peacekeeper loved wild turkey the mayor had a
passion for strawberries
in late summer i was washing up in a pond when i
noticed the plants growing around me tall with
leaves like arrowheads blossoms with three white
petals i knelt down in the water my fingers digging
into the soft mud and i pulled up handfuls of the
roots small bluish tubers that dont look like much
but boiled or baked are as good as any potato
katniss i said aloud its the plant i was named for
and i heard my fathers voice joking as long as you
can find yourself youll never starve i spent hours
stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick
gathering the tubers that floated to the top that
night we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we
were all for the first time in months full
slowly my mother returned to us she began to clean
and cook and preserve some of the food i brought in
for winter people traded us or paid money for her
medical remedies one day i heard her singing
prim was thrilled to have her back but i kept
watching waiting for her to disappear on us again i
didnt trust her and some small gnarled place inside
me hated her for her weakness for her neglect for
the months she had put us through prim forgave her
but i had taken a step back from my mother put up a
wall to protect myself from needing her and nothing
was ever the same between us again
now i was going to die without that ever being set
right i thought of how i had yelled at her today in the
justice building i had told her i loved her too
though so maybe it would all balance out
for a while i stand staring out the train window
wishing i could open it again but unsure of what

would happen at such high speed in the distance i
see the lights of another district 7 10 i dont know
i think about the people in their houses settling in
for bed i imagine my home with its shutters drawn
tight what are they doing now my mother and prim
were they able to eat supper the fish stew and the
strawberries or did it lay untouched on their plates
did they watch the recap of the days events on the
battered old tv that sits on the table against the
wall surely there were more tears is my mother
holding up being strong for prim or has she already
started to slip away leaving the weight of the world
on my sisters fragile shoulders
prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight
the thought of that scruffy old buttercup posting
himself on the bed to watch over prim comforts me if
she cries he will nose his way into her arms and curl
up there until she calms down and falls asleep im so
glad i didnt drown him
imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness
this day has been endless could gale and i have
been eating blackberries only this morning it seems
like a lifetime ago like a long dream that deteriorated
into a nightmare maybe if i go to sleep i will wake
up back in district 12 where i belong
probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns
but i just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into
bed in my underwear the sheets are made of soft
silky fabric a thick fluffy comforter gives immediate
warmth
if im going to cry now is the time to do it by
morning 111 be able to wash the damage done by the
tears from my face but no tears come im too tired or
too numb to cry the only thing i feel is a desire to be

somewhere else so i let the train rock me into
oblivion
gray light is leaking through the curtains when the
rapping rouses me i hear effie trinkets voice calling
me to rise up up up its going to be a big big big
day i try and imagine for a moment what it must
be like inside that womans head what thoughts fill
her waking hours what dreams come to her at
night i have no idea
i put the green outfit back on since its not really
dirty just slightly crumpled from spending the night
on the floor my fingers trace the circle around the
little gold mockingj ay and i think of the woods and of
my father and of my mother and prim waking up
having to get on with things
i slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for
the reaping and it doesnt look too bad so i just leave
it up it doesnt matter we cant be far from the
capitol now and once we reach the city my stylist
will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies
tonight anyway i just hope i get one who doesnt
think nudity is the last word in fashion
as i enter the dining car effie trinket brushes by me
with a cup of black coffee shes muttering obscenities
under her breath haymitch his face puffy and red
from the previous days indulgences is chuckling
peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassed
sit down sit down says haymitch waving me over
the moment i slide into my chair im served an
enormous platter of food eggs ham piles of fried
potatoes a tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled
the basket of rolls they set before me would keep my
family going for a week theres an elegant glass of
orange juice at least i think its orange juice ive

only even tasted an orange once at new years when
my father bought one as a special treat a cup of
coffee my mother adores coffee which we could
almost never afford but it only tastes bitter and thin
to me a rich brown cup of something ive never seen
they call it hot chocolate says peeta its good
i take a sip of the hot sweet creamy liquid and a
shudder runs through me even though the rest of
the meal beckons i ignore it until ive drained my
cup then i stuff down every mouthful i can hold
which is a substantial amount being careful to not
overdo it on the richest stuff one time my mother
told me that i always eat like 111 never see food again
and i said i wont unless i bring it home that shut
her up
when my stomach feels like its about to split open i
lean back and take in my breakfast companions
peeta is still eating breaking off bits of roll and
dipping them in hot chocolate haymitch hasnt paid
much attention to his platter but hes knocking back
a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear
liquid from a bottle judging by the fumes its some
kind of spirit i dont know haymitch but ive seen
him often enough in the hob tossing handfuls of
money on the counter of the woman who sells white
liquor hell be incoherent by the time we reach the
capitol
i realize i detest haymitch no wonder the district 12
tributes never stand a chance it isnt just that weve
been underfed and lack training some of our tributes
have still been strong enough to make a go of it but
we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the
reason why the rich people who back tributes —
either because theyre betting on them or simply for

the bragging rights of picking a winner — expect
someone classier than haymitch to deal with
so youre supposed to give us advice i say to
haymitch
heres some advice stay alive says haymitch and
then bursts out laughing i exchange a look with
peeta before i remember im having nothing more to
do with him im surprised to see the hardness in his
eyes he generally seems so mild
thats very funny says peeta suddenly he lashes
out at the glass in haymitch s hand it shatters on the
floor sending the bloodred liquid running toward the
back of the train only not to us
haymitch considers this a moment then punches
peeta in the jaw knocking him from his chair when
he turns back to reach for the spirits i drive my knife
into the table between his hand and the bottle barely
missing his fingers i brace myself to deflect his hit
but it doesnt come instead he sits back and squints
at us
well whats this says haymitch did i actually get
a pair of fighters this year
peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of
ice from under the fruit tureen he starts to raise it to
the red mark on his jaw
no says haymitch stopping him let the bruise
show the audience will think youve mixed it up with
another tribute before youve even made it to the
arena
thats against the rules says peeta

only if they catch you that bruise will say you
fought you werent caught even better says
haymitch he turns to me can you hit anything
with that knife besides a table
the bow and arrow is my weapon but ive spent a
fair amount of time throwing knives as well
sometimes if ive wounded an animal with an arrow
its better to get a knife into it too before i approach
it i realize that if i want haymitch s attention this is
my moment to make an impression i yank the knife
out of the table get a grip on the blade and then
throw it into the wall across the room i was actually
just hoping to get a good solid stick but it lodges in
the seam between two panels making me look a lot
better than i am
stand over here both of you says haymitch
nodding to the middle of the room we obey and he
circles us prodding us like animals at times
checking our muscles examining our faces well
youre not entirely hopeless seem fit and once the
stylists get hold of you youll be attractive enough
peeta and i dont question this the hunger games
arent a beauty contest but the bestlooking tributes
always seem to pull more sponsors
all right ill make a deal with you you dont
interfere with my drinking and 111 stay sober enough
to help you says haymitch but you have to do
exactly what i say
its not much of a deal but still a giant step forward
from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all
fine says peeta

so help us i say when we get to the arena whats
the best strategy at the cornucopia for someone —
one thing at a time in a few minutes well be
pulling into the station youll be put in the hands of
your stylists youre not going to like what they do to
you but no matter what it is dont resist says
haymitch
but —  i begin
no buts dont resist says haymitch he takes the
bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car as
the door swings shut behind him the car goes dark
there are still a few lights inside but outside its as if
night has fallen again i realize we must be in the
tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the
capitol the mountains form a natural barrier
between the capitol and the eastern districts it is
almost impossible to enter from the east except
through the tunnels this geographical advantage was
a major factor in the districts losing the war that led
to my being a tribute today since the rebels had to
scale the mountains they were easy targets for the
capitols air forces
peeta mellark and i stand in silence as the train
speeds along the tunnel goes on and on and i think
of the tons of rock separating me from the sky and
my chest tightens i hate being encased in stone this
way it reminds me of the mines and my father
trapped unable to reach sunlight buried forever in
the darkness
the train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright
light floods the compartment we cant help it both
peeta and i run to the window to see what weve only
seen on television the capitol the ruling city of
panem the cameras havent lied about its grandeur

if anything they have not quite captured the
magnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow
of hues that tower into the air the shiny cars that roll
down the wide paved streets the oddly dressed people
with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never
missed a meal all the colors seem artificial the pinks
too deep the greens too bright the yellows painful to
the eyes like the flat round disks of hard candy we
can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in
district 12
the people begin to point at us eagerly as they
recognize a tribute train rolling into the city i step
away from the window sickened by their excitement
knowing they cant wait to watch us die but peeta
holds his ground actually waving and smiling at the
gawking crowd he only stops when the train pulls
into the station blocking us from their view
he sees me staring at him and shrugs who knows
he says one of them may be rich
i have misjudged him i think of his actions since the
reaping began the friendly squeeze of my hand his
father showing up with the cookies and promising to
feed prim    did peeta put him up to that his tears
at the station volunteering to wash haymitch but
then challenging him this morning when apparently
the niceguy approach had failed and now the
waving at the window already trying to win the
crowd
all of the pieces are still fitting together but i sense
he has a plan forming he hasnt accepted his death
he is already fighting hard to stay alive which also
means that kind peeta mellark the boy who gave me
the bread is fighting hard to kill me

riiip i grit my teeth as venia a woman with aqua
hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows yanks a
strip of fabric from my leg tearing out the hair
beneath it sorry she pipes in her silly capitol
accent youre just so hairy
why do these people speak in such a high pitch why
do their jaws barely open when they talk why do the
ends of their sentences go up as if theyre asking a
question odd vowels clipped words and always a
hiss on the letter s  no wonder its impossible not to
mimic them
venia makes whats supposed to be a sympathetic
face good news though this is the last one
readyiget a grip on the edges of the table im seated
on and nod the final swathe of my leg hair is
uprooted in a painful jerk
ive been in the remake center for more than three
hours and i still havent met my stylist apparently he
has no interest in seeing me until venia and the other
members of my prep team have addressed some
obvious problems this has included scrubbing down
my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only
dirt but at least three layers of skin turning my nails
into uniform shapes and primarily ridding my body
of hair my legs arms torso underarms and parts of
my eyebrows have been stripped of the muff leaving
me like a plucked bird ready for roasting i dont like
it my skin feels sore and tingling and intensely
vulnerable but i have kept my side of the bargain
with haymitch and no objection has crossed my lips

youre doing very well says some guy named
flavius he gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake
and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his
mouth if theres one thing we cant stand its a
whiner grease her down
venia and octavia a plump woman whose entire
body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green rub me
down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes
my raw skin then they pull me from the table
removing the thin robe ive been allowed to wear off
and on i stand there completely naked as the three
circle me wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of
hair i know i should be embarrassed but theyre so
unlike people that im no more selfconscious than if
a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my
feet
the three step back and admire their work
excellent you almost look like a human being now
says flavius and they all laugh
i force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful i
am thank you i say sweetly we dont have much
cause to look nice in district twelve
this wins them over completely of course you
dont you poor darling says octavia clasping her
hands together in distress for me
but dont worry says venia by the time cinna is
through with you youre going to be absolutely
gorgeous
we promise you know now that weve gotten rid of
all the hair and filth youre not horrible at all says
flavius encouragingly lets call cinna

they dart out of the room its hard to hate my prep
team theyre such total idiots and yet in an odd
way i know theyre sincerely trying to help me
i look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the
impulse to retrieve my robe but this cinna my
stylist will surely make me remove it at once instead
my hands go to my hairdo the one area of my body
my prep team had been told to leave alone my fingers
stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully
arranged my mother i left her blue dress and shoes
on the floor of my train car never thinking about
retrieving them of trying to hold on to a piece of her
of home now i wish i had
the door opens and a young man who must be cinna
enters im taken aback by how normal he looks most
of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed
stenciled and surgically altered theyre grotesque
but cinnas closecropped hair appears to be its
natural shade of brown hes in a simple black shirt
and pants the only concession to selfalteration
seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been
applied with a light hand it brings out the flecks of
gold in his green eyes and despite my disgust with
the capitol and their hideous fashions i cant help
thinking how attractive it looks
hello katniss im cinna your stylist he says in a
quiet voice somewhat lacking in the capitols
affectations
hello i venture cautiously
just give me a moment all right he asks he walks
around my naked body not touching me but taking
in every inch of it with his eyes i resist the impulse to
cross my arms over my chest who did your hair

my mother i say
its beautiful classic really and in almost perfect
balance with your profile she has very clever fingers
he says
i had expected someone flamboyant someone older
trying desperately to look young someone who viewed
me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter
cinna has met none of these expectations
youre new arent you i dont think ive seen you
before i say most of the stylists are familiar
constants in the everchanging pool of tributes some
have been around my whole life
yes this is my first year in the games says cinna
so they gave you district twelve i say newcomers
generally end up with us the least desirable district
i asked for district twelve he says without further
explanation why dont you put on your robe and
well have a chat
pulling on my robe i follow him through a door into a
sitting room two red couches face off over a low
table three walls are blank the fourth is entirely
glass providing a window to the city i can see by the
light that it must be around noon although the
sunny sky has turned overcast cinna invites me to
sit on one of the couches and takes his place across
from me he presses a button on the side of the table
the top splits and from below rises a second tabletop
that holds our lunch chicken and chunks of oranges
cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly
white grain tiny green peas and onions rolls shaped
like flowers and for dessert a pudding the color of
honey

i try to imagine assembling this meal myself back
home chickens are too expensive but i could make
do with a wild turkey id need to shoot a second
turkey to trade for an orange goats milk would have
to substitute for cream we can grow peas in the
garden id have to get wild onions from the woods i
dont recognize the grain our own tessera ration
cooks down to an unattractive brown mush fancy
rolls would mean another trade with the baker
perhaps for two or three squirrels as for the pudding
i cant even guess whats in it days of hunting and
gathering for this one meal and even then it would be
a poor substitution for the capitol version
what must it be like i wonder to live in a world
where food appears at the press of a button how
would i spend the hours i now commit to combing the
woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by
what do they do all day these people in the capitol
besides decorating their bodies and waiting around
for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for
their entertainment
i look up and find cinnas eyes trained on mine how
despicable we must seem to you he says
has he seen this in my face or somehow read my
thoughts hes right though the whole rotten lot of
them is despicable
no matter says cinna so katniss about your
costume for the opening ceremonies my partner
portia is the stylist for your fellow tribute peeta and
our current thought is to dress you in complementary
costumes says cinna as you know its customary
to reflect the flavor of the district
for the opening ceremonies youre supposed to wear
something that suggests your districts principal

industry district 11 agriculture district 4 fishing
district 3 factories this means that coming from
district 12 peeta and i will be in some kind of coal
miners getup since the baggy miners jumpsuits are
not particularly becoming our tributes usually end
up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps one
year our tributes were stark naked and covered in
black powder to represent coal dust its always
dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the
crowd i prepare myself for the worst
so ill be in a coal miner outfit i ask hoping it
wont be indecent
not exactly you see portia and i think that coal
miner things very overdone no one will remember
you in that and we both see it as our job to make the
district twelve tributes unforgettable says cinna
ill be naked for sure i think
so rather than focus on the coal mining itself were
going to focus on the coal says cinna naked and
covered in black dust i think and what do we do
with coal we burn it says cinna
youre not afraid of fire are you katniss he sees
my expression and grins
a few hours later i am dressed in what will either be
the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the
opening ceremonies im in a simple black unitard
that covers me from ankle to neck shiny leather
boots lace up to my knees but its the fluttering cape
made of streams of orange yellow and red and the
matching headpiece that define this costume cinna
plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls
into the streets

its not real flame of course just a little synthetic
fire portia and i came up with youll be perfectly
safe he says but im not convinced i wont be
perfectly barbecued by the time we reach the citys
center
my face is relatively clear of makeup just a bit of
highlighting here and there my hair has been
brushed out and then braided down my back in my
usual style i want the audience to recognize you
when youre in the arena says cinna
dreamily katniss the girl who was on fire
it crosses my mind that cinnas calm and normal
demeanor masks a complete madman
despite this mornings revelation about peetas
character im actually relieved when he shows up
dressed in an identical costume he should know
about fire being a bakers son and all his stylist
portia and her team accompany him in and everyone
is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a
splash well make except cinna he just seems a bit
weary as he accepts congratulations
were whisked down to the bottom level of the
remake center which is essentially a gigantic stable
the opening ceremonies are about to start pairs of
tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by
teams of four horses ours are coal black the
animals are so well trained no one even needs to
guide their reins cinna and portia direct us into the
chariot and carefully arrange our body positions the
drape of our capes before moving off to consult with
each other
what do you think i whisper to peeta about the
fire

ill rip off your cape if you 11 rip off mine he says
through gritted teeth
deal i say maybe if we can get them off soon
enough well avoid the worst burns its bad though
theyll throw us into the arena no matter what
condition were in i know we promised haymitch
wed do exactly what they said but i dont think he
considered this angle
where is haymitch anyway isnt he supposed to
protect us from this sort of thing says peeta
with all that alcohol in him its probably not
advisable to have him around an open flame i say
and suddenly were both laughing i guess were both
so nervous about the games and more pressingly
petrified of being turned into human torches were
not acting sensibly
the opening music begins its easy to hear blasted
around the capitol massive doors slide open
revealing the crowdlined streets the ride lasts about
twenty minutes and ends up at the city circle where
they will welcome us play the anthem and escort us
into the training center which will be our
home prison until the games begin
the tributes from district 1 ride out in a chariot
pulled by snowwhite horses they look so beautiful
spraypainted silver in tasteful tunics glittering with
jewels district 1 makes luxury items for the capitol
you can hear the roarofthe crowd they are always
favorites
district 2 gets into position to follow them in no time
at all we are approaching the door and i can see that
between the overcast sky and evening hour the light

is turning gray the tributes from district 1 1 are just
rolling out when cinna appears with a lighted torch
here we go then he says and before we can react
he sets our capes on fire i gasp waiting for the heat
but there is only a faint tickling sensation cinna
climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses he
lets out a sign of relief it works then he gently
tucks a hand under my chin remember heads high
smiles theyre going to love you
cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea he
shouts something up at us but the music drowns
him out he shouts again and gestures
whats he saying i ask peeta for the first time i
look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake
flames he is dazzling and i must be too
i think he said for us to hold hands says peeta he
grabs my right hand in his left and we look to cinna
for confirmation he nods and gives a thumbsup
and thats the last thing i see before we enter the city
the crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly
changes to cheers and shouts of district twelve
every head is turned our way pulling the focus from
the three chariots ahead of us at first im frozen but
then i catch sight of us on a large television screen
and am floored by how breathtaking we look in the
deepening twilight the firelight illuminates our faces
we seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing
capes cinna was right about the minimal makeup
we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable
remember heads high smiles theyre going to love
you i hear cinnas voice in my head i lift my chin a
bit higher put on my most winning smile and wave
with my free hand im glad now i have peeta to clutch
for balance he is so steady solid as a rock as i gain

confidence i actually blow a few kisses to the crowd
the people of the capitol are going nuts showering
us with flowers shouting our names our first names
which they have bothered to find on the program
the pounding music the cheers the admiration work
their way into my blood and i cant suppress my
excitement cinna has given me a great advantage no
one will forget me not my look not my name
katniss the girl who was on fire
for the first time i feel a flicker of hope rising up in
me surely there must be one sponsor willing to take
me on and with a little extra help some food the
right weapon why should i count myself out of the
games
someone throws me a red rose i catch it give it a
delicate sniff and blow a kiss back in the general
direction of the giver a hundred hands reach up to
catch my kiss as if it were a real and tangible thing
katniss katniss i can hear my name being called
from all sides everyone wants my kisses
its not until we enter the city circle that i realize i
must have completely stopped the circulation in
peetas hand thats how tightly ive been holding it i
look down at our linked fingers as i loosen my grasp
but he regains his grip on me no dont let go of me
he says the firelight flickers off his blue eyes
please i might fall out of this thing
okay i say so i keep holding on but i cant help
feeling strange about the way cinna has linked us
together its not really fair to present us as a team
and then lock us into the arena to kill each other

the twelve chariots fill the loop of the city circle on
the buildings that surround the circle every window
is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the
capitol our horses pull our chariot right up to
president snows mansion and we come to a halt
the music ends with a flourish
the president a small thin man with paperwhite
hair gives the official welcome from a balcony above
us it is traditional to cut away to the faces of the
tributes during the speech but i can see on the
screen that we are getting way more than our share of
airtime the darker it becomes the more difficult it is
to take your eyes off our flickering when the national
anthem plays they do make an effort to do a quick
cut around to each pair of tributes but the camera
holds on the district 12 chariot as it parades around
the circle one final time and disappears into the
training center
the doors have only just shut behind us when were
engulfed by the prep teams who are nearly
unintelligible as they babble out praise as i glance
around i notice a lot of the other tributes are
shooting us dirty looks which confirms what ive
suspected weve literally outshone them all then
cinna and portia are there helping us down from the
chariot carefully removing our flaming capes and
headdresses portia extinguishes them with some
kind of spray from a canister
i realize im still glued to peeta and force my stiff
fingers to open we both massage our hands
thanks for keeping hold of me i was getting a little
shaky there says peeta
it didnt show i tell him im sure no one noticed

im sure they didnt notice anything but you you
should wear flames more often he says they suit
you and then he gives me a smile that seems so
genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness
that unexpected warmth rushes through me
a warning bell goes off in my head dont be so
stupid peeta is planning how to kill you i remind
myself he is luring you in to make you easy prey the
more likable he is the more deadly he is
but because two can play at this game i stand on
tiptoe and kiss his cheek right on his bruise

6
the training center has a tower designed exclusively
for the tributes and their teams this will be our
home until the actual games begin each district has
an entire floor you simply step onto an elevator and
press the number of your district easy enough to
remember
ive ridden the elevator a couple of times in the
justice building back in district 12 once to receive
the medal for my fathers death and then yesterday to
say my final goodbyes to my friends and family but
thats a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail
and smells of sour milk the walls of this elevator are
made of crystal so that you can watch the people on
the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into
the air its exhilarating and im tempted to ask effie
trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that
seems childish
apparently effie trinkets duties did not conclude at
the station she and haymitch will be overseeing us
right into the arena in a way thats a plus because at
least she can be counted on to corral us around to
places on time whereas we havent seen haymitch
since he agreed to help us on the train probably
passed out somewhere effie trinket on the other
hand seems to be flying high were the first team
shes ever chaperoned that made a splash at the
opening ceremonies shes complimentary about not
just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves
and to hear her tell it effie knows everyone whos
anyone in the capitol and has been talking us up all
day trying to win us sponsors

ive been very mysterious though she says her
eyes squint half shut because of course haymitch
hasnt bothered to tell me your strategies but ive
done my best with what i had to work with how
katniss sacrificed herself for her sister how youve
both successfully struggled to overcome the
barbarism of your district
barbarism thats ironic coming from a woman
helping to prepare us for slaughter and whats she
basing our success on our table manners
everyone has their reservations naturally you being
from the coal district but i said and this was very
clever of me i said well if you put enough pressure
on coal it turns to pearls effie beams at us so
brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond
enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its
wrong
coal doesnt turn to pearls they grow in shellfish
possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds but thats
untrue too ive heard they have some sort of
machine in district 1 that can turn graphite into
diamonds but we dont mine graphite in district 12
that was part of district 13s job until they were
destroyed
i wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all
day either know or care
unfortunately i cant seal the sponsor deals for you
only haymitch can do that says effie grimly but
dont worry 111 get him to the table at gunpoint if
necessary
although lacking in many departments effie trinket
has a certain determination i have to admire

my quarters are larger than our entire house back
home they are plush like the train car but also
have so many automatic gadgets that im sure i wont
have time to press all the buttons the shower alone
has a panel with more than a hundred options you
can choose regulating water temperature pressure
soaps shampoos scents oils and massaging
sponges when you step out on a mat heaters come
on that blowdry your body instead of struggling with
the knots in my wet hair i merely place my hand on a
box that sends a current through my scalp
untangling parting and drying my hair almost
instantly it floats down around my shoulders in a
glossy curtain
i program the closet for an outfit to my taste the
windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my
command you need only whisper a type of food from
a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears
hot and steamy before you in less than a minute i
walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy
bread until theres a knock on the door effies calling
me to dinner
good im starving
peeta cinna and portia are standing out on a
balcony that overlooks the capitol when we enter the
dining room im glad to see the stylists particularly
after i hear that haymitch will be joining us a meal
presided over by just
effie and haymitch is bound to be a disaster besides
dinner isnt really about food its about planning out
our strategies and cinna and portia have already
proven how valuable they are
a silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us
all stemmed glasses of wine i think about turning it

down but ive never had wine except the homemade
stuff my mother uses for coughs and when will i get
a chance to try it again i take a sip of the tart dry
liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a
few spoonfuls of honey
haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served it
looks as if hes had his own stylist because hes clean
and groomed and about as sober as ive ever seen
him he doesnt refuse the offer of wine but when he
starts in on his soup i realize its the first time ive
ever seen him eat maybe he really will pull himself
together long enough to help us
cinna and portia seem to have a civilizing effect on
haymitch and effie at least theyre addressing each
other decently and they both have nothing but praise
for our stylists opening act while they make small
talk i concentrate on the meal mushroom soup
bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas rare roast
beef sliced as thin as paper noodles in a green sauce
cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet
blue grapes the servers all young people dressed in
white tunics like the one who gave us wine move
wordlessly to and from the table keeping the platters
and glasses full
about halfway through my glass of wine my head
starts feeling foggy so i change to water instead i
dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon how
haymitch can stand walking around like this fulltime
is a mystery
i try to focus on the talk which has turned to our
interview costumes when a girl sets a gorgeous
looking cake on the table and deftly lights it it blazes
up and then the flames flicker around the edges
awhile until it finally goes out i have a moment of
doubt what makes it burn is it alcohol i say

looking up at the girl thats the last thing i wa —
oh i know you
i cant place a name or time to the girls face but im
certain of it the dark red hair the striking features
the porcelain white skin but even as i utter the
words i feel my insides contracting with anxiety and
guilt at the sight of her and while i cant pull it up i
know some bad memory is associated with her the
expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to
my confusion and unease she shakes her head in
denial quickly and hurries away from the table
when i look back the four adults are watching me
like hawks
dont be ridiculous katniss how could you possibly
know an avox snaps effie the very thought
whats an avox i ask stupidly
someone who committed a crime they cut her
tongue so she cant speak says haymitch shes
probably a traitor of some sort not likely youd know
her
and even if you did youre not to speak to one of
them unless its to give an order says effie of
course you dont really know her
but i do know her and now that haymitch has
mentioned the word traitor i remember from where
the disapproval is so high i could never admit it no
i guess not i just —  i stammer and the wine is not
helping
peeta snaps his fingers delly cartwright thats who
it is i kept thinking she looked familiar as well then
i realized shes a dead ringer for delly

delly cartwright is a pastyfaced lumpy girl with
yellowish hair who looks about as much like our
server as a beetle does a butterfly she may also be
the friendliest person on the planet — she smiles
constantly at everybody in school even me i have
never seen the girl with the red hair smile but i jump
on peetas suggestion gratefully of course thats
who i was thinking of it must be the hair i say
something about the eyes too says peeta
the energy at the table relaxes oh well if thats all
it is says cinna and yes the cake has spirits but
all the alcohol has burned off i ordered it specially in
honor of your fiery debut
we eat the cake and move into a sitting room to
watch the replay of the opening ceremonies thats
being broadcast a few of the other couples make a
nice impression but none of them can hold a candle
to us even our own party lets out an ahh as they
show us coming out of the remake center
whose idea was the hand holding asks haymitch
cinnas says portia
just the perfect touch of rebellion says
haymitch very nice
rebellion i have to think about that one a moment
but when i remember the other couples standing
stiffly apart never touching or acknowledging each
other as if their fellow tribute did not exist as if the
games had already begun i know what haymitch
means presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as
friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery
costumes

tomorrow morning is the first training session meet
me for breakfast and ill tell you exactly how i want
you to play it says haymitch to peeta and i now go
get some sleep while the grownups talk
peeta and i walk together down the corridor to our
rooms when we get to my door he leans against the
frame not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting
i pay attention to him so delly cartwright imagine
finding her lookalike here
hes asking for an explanation and im tempted to
give him one we both know he covered for me so
here i am in his debt again if i tell him the truth
about the girl somehow that might even things up
how can it hurt really even if he repeated the story
it couldnt do me much harm it was just something i
witnessed and he lied as much as i did about delly
cartwright
i realize i do want to talk to someone about the girl
someone who might be able to help me figure out her
story
gale would be my first choice but its unlikely ill ever
see gale again i try to think if telling peeta could give
him any possible advantage over me but i dont see
how maybe sharing a confidence will actually make
him believe i see him as a friend
besides the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue
frightens me she has reminded me why im here not
to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies but to
die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer
to tell or not to tell my brain still feels slow from the
wine i stare down the empty corridor as if the
decision lies there

peeta picks up on my hesitation have you been on
the roof yet i shake my head cinna showed me
you can practically see the whole city the winds a
bit loud though
i translate this into no one will overhear us
talkingin my head you do have the sense that we
might be under surveillance here can we just go
up
sure come on says peeta i follow him to a flight of
stairs that lead to the roof theres a small dome
shaped room with a door to the outside as we step
into the cool windy evening air i catch my breath at
the view the capitol twinkles like a vast field of
fireflies electricity in district 12 comes and goes
usually we only have it a few hours a day often the
evenings are spent in candlelight the only time you
can count on it is when theyre airing the games or
some important government message on television
that its mandatory to watch but here there would be
no shortage ever
peeta and i walk to a railing at the edge of the roof i
look straight down the side of the building to the
street which is buzzing with people you can hear
their cars an occasional shout and a strange
metallic tinkling in district 12 wed all be thinking
about bed right now
i asked cinna why they let us up here werent they
worried that some of the tributes might decide to
jump right over the side says peeta
whatd he say i ask
you cant says peeta he holds out his hand into
seemingly empty space theres a sharp zap and he

jerks it back some kind of electric field throws you
back on the roof
always worried about our safety i say even though
cinna has shown peeta the roof i wonder if were
supposed to be up here now so late and alone ive
never seen tributes on the training center roof
before but that doesnt mean were not being taped
do you think theyre watching us now
maybe he admits come see the garden
on the other side of the dome theyve built a garden
with flower beds and potted trees from the branches
hang hundreds of wind chimes which account for the
tinkling i heard here in the garden on this windy
night its enough to drown out two people who are
trying not to be heard peeta looks at me expectantly
i pretend to examine a blossom we were hunting in
the woods one day hidden waiting for game i
whisper
you and your father he whispers back
no my friend gale suddenly all the birds stopped
singing at once except one as if it were giving a
warning call and then we saw her im sure it was
the same girl a boy was with her their clothes were
tattered they had dark circles under their eyes from
no sleep they were running as if their lives depended
on it i say
for a moment im silent as i remember how the sight
of this strange pair clearly not from district 12
fleeing through the woods immobilized us later we
wondered if we could have helped them escape
perhaps we might have concealed them if wed
moved quickly gale and i were taken by surprise

yes but were both hunters we know how animals
look at bay we knew the pair was in trouble as soon
as we saw them but we only watched
the hovercraft appeared out of nowhere i continue
to peeta i mean one moment the sky was empty and
the next it was there it didnt make a sound but they
saw it a net dropped down on the girl and carried her
up fast so fast like the elevator they shot some sort
of spear through the boy it was attached to a cable
and they hauled him up as well but im certain he
was dead we heard the girl scream once the boys
name i think then it was gone the hovercraft
vanished into thin air and the birds began to sing
again as if nothing had happened
did they see you peeta asked
i dont know we were under a shelf of rock i reply
but i do know there was a moment after the
birdcall but before the hovercraft where the girl had
seen us shed locked eyes with me and called out for
help but neither gale or i had responded
youre shivering says peeta
the wind and the story have blown all the warmth
from my body the girls scream had it been her last
peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my
shoulders i start to take a step back but then i let
him deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket
and his kindness a friend would do that right
they were from here he asks and he secures a
button at my neck

i nod theyd had that capitol look about them the
boy and the girl
where do you suppose they were going he asks
i dont know that i say district 12 is pretty much
the end of the line beyond us theres only
wilderness if you dont count the ruins of district 13
that still smolder from the toxic bombs they show it
on television occasionally just to remind us or why
they would leave here haymitch had called the
avoxes traitors against what it could only be the
capitol but they had everything here no cause to
rebel
id leave here peeta blurts out then he looks
around nervously it was loud enough to hear above
the chimes he laughs id go home now if they let me
but you have to admit the foods prime
hes covered again if thats all youd heard it would
just sound like the words of a scared tribute not
someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness
of the capitol
its getting chilly we better go in he says inside
the dome its warm and bright his tone is
conversational your friend gale hes the one who
took your sister away at the reaping
yes do you know him i ask
not really i hear the girls talk about him a lot i
thought he was your cousin or something you favor
each other he says
no were not related i say

peeta nods unreadable did he come to say goodbye
to you
yes i say observing him carefully so did your
father he brought me cookies
peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news but after
watching him lie so smoothly i dont give this much
weight really well he likes you and your sister i
think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a
houseful of boys
the idea that i might ever have been discussed
around the dinner table at the bakery fire just in
passing in peetas house gives me a start it must
have been when the mother was out of the room
he knew your mother when they were kids says
peeta
another surprise but probably true oh yes she
grew up in town i say it seems impolite to say she
never mentioned the baker except to compliment his
bread
were at my door i give back his jacket see you in
the morning then
see you he says and walks off down the hall
when i open my door the redheaded girl is collecting
my unitard and boots from where i left them on the
floor before my shower i want to apologize for
possibly getting her in trouble earlier but i remember
im not supposed to speak to her unless im giving her
an order
oh sorry i say i was supposed to get those back
to cinna im sorry can you take them to him

she avoids my eyes gives a small nod and heads out
the door
id set out to tell her i was sorry about dinner but i
know that my apology runs much deeper that im
ashamed i never tried to help her in the woods that i
let the capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without
lifting a finger
just like i was watching the games
i kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my
clothes the shivering hasnt stopped perhaps the girl
doesnt even remember me but i know she does you
dont forget the face of the person who was your last
hope i pull the covers up over my head as if this will
protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak
but i can feel her eyes staring at me piercing through
walls and doors and bedding
i wonder if shell enjoy watching me die

7
my slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams the
face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory
images from earlier hunger games with my mother
withdrawn and unreachable with prim emaciated
and terrified i bolt up screaming for my father to run
as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of
light
dawn is breaking through the windows the capitol
has a misty haunted air my head aches and i must
have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night my
tongue probes the ragged flesh and i taste blood
slowly i drag myself out of bed and into the shower i
arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and
end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of
icy cold and steaming hot water assault me then im
deluged in lemony foam that i have to scrape off with
a heavy bristled brush oh well at least my blood is
flowing
when im dried and moisturized with lotion i find an
outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet
tight black pants a longsleeved burgundy tunic and
leather shoes i put my hair in the single braid down
my back this is the first time since the morning of
the reaping that i resemble myself no fancy hair and
clothes no flaming capes just me looking like i
could be headed for the woods it calms me
haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for
breaklast and no one has contacted me this
morning but im hungry so i head down to the dining
room hoping there will be food im not disappointed

while the table is empty a long board off to the side
has been laid with at least twenty dishes a young
man an avox stands at attention by the spread
when i ask if i can serve myself he nods assent i
load a plate with eggs sausages batter cakes covered
in thick orange preserves slices of pale purple melon
as i gorge myself i watch the sun rise over the
capitol i have a second plate of hot grain smothered
in beef stew finally i fill a plate with rolls and sit at
the table breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot
chocolate the way peeta did on the train
my mind wanders to my mother and prim they must
be up my mother getting their breakfast of mush
prim milking her goat before school just two
mornings ago i was home can that be right yes
just two and now how empty the house feels even
from a distance what did they say last night about
my fiery debut at the games did it give them hope
or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality
of twentyfour tributes circled together knowing only
one could live
haymitch and peeta come in bid me good morning
fill their plates it makes me irritated that peeta is
wearing exactly the same outfit i am i need to say
something to cinna this twins act is going to blow
up in out faces once the games begin surely they
must know this then i remember haymitch telling
me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do if it
was anyone but cinna i might be tempted to ignore
him but after last nights triumph i dont have a lot
of room to criticize his choices
im nervous about the training there will be three
days in which all the tributes practice together on
the last afternoon well each get a chance to perform
in private before the gamemakers the thought of
meeting the other tributes facetoface makes me

queasy i turn the roll i have just taken from the
basket over and over in my hands but my appetite is
gone
when haymitch has finished several platters of stew
he pushes back his plate with a sigh he takes a flask
from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans
his elbows on the table so lets get down to
business training first off if you like 111 coach you
separately decide now
why would you coach us separately i ask
say if you had a secret skill you might not want the
other to know about says haymitch
i exchange a look with peeta i dont have any secret
skills he says and i already know what yours is
right i mean ive eaten enough of your squirrels
i never thought about peeta eating the squirrels i
shot somehow i always pictured the baker quietly
going off and frying them up for himself not out of
greed but because town families usually eat
expensive butcher meat beef and chicken and horse
you can coach us together i tell haymitch peeta
nods
all right so give me some idea of what you can
do says haymitch
i cant do anything says peeta unless you count
baking bread
sorry i dont katniss i already know youre handy
with a knife says haymitch

not really but i can hunt i say with a bow and
arrow
and youre good asks haymitch
i have to think about it ive been putting food on the
table for four years thats no small task im not as
good as my father was but hed had more practice
ive better aim than gale but ive had more practice
hes a genius with traps and snares im all right i
say
shes excellent says peeta my father buys her
squirrels he always comments on how the arrows
never pierce the body she hits every one in the eye
its the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher
she can even bring down deer
this assessment of my skills from peeta takes me
totally by surprise first that he ever noticed
second that hes talking me up what are you
doing i ask him suspiciously
what are you doing if hes going to help you he has
to know what youre capable of dont underrate
yourself says peeta
i dont know why but this rubs me the wrong way
what about you ive seen you in the market you
can lift hundredpound bags of flour i snap at him
tell him that thats not nothing
yes and im sure the arena will be full of bags of
flour for me to chuck at people its not like being able
to use a weapon you know it isnt he shoots back
he can wrestle i tell haymitch he came in second
in our school competition last year only after his
brother

what use is that how many times have you seen
someone wrestle someone to death says peeta in
disgust
theres always handtohand combat all you need is
to come up with a knife and youll at least stand a
chance if i get jumped im dead i can hear my voice
rising in anger
but you wont youll be living up in some tree eating
raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows you
know what my mother said to me when she came to
say goodbye as if to cheer me up she says maybe
district twelve will finally have a winner then i
realized she didnt mean me she meant you bursts
out peeta
oh she meant you i say with a wave of dismissal
she said shes a survivor that onesheis says
peeta
that pulls me up short did his mother really say that
about me did she rate me over her son i see the
pain in peetas eyes and know he isnt lying
suddenly im behind the bakery and i can feel the
chill of the rain running down my back the
hollowness in my belly i sound eleven years old when
i speak but only because someone helped me
peetas eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands and
i know he remembers that day too but he just
shrugs people will help you in the arena they 11 be
tripping over each other to sponsor you
no more than you i say

peeta rolls his eyes at haymitch she has no idea
the effect she can have he runs his fingernail along
the wood grain in the table refusing to look at me
what on earth does he mean people help me when
we were dying of starvation no one helped me no one
except peeta once i had something to barter with
things changed im a tough trader or am i what
effect do i have that im weak and needy is he
suggesting that i got good deals because people pitied
me i try to think if this is true perhaps some of the
merchants were a little generous in their trades but i
always attributed that to their longstanding
relationship with my father besides my game is first
class no one pitied me
i glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me
after about a minute of this haymitch says well
then well well well katniss theres no guarantee
theyll be bows and arrows in the arena but during
your private session with the gamemakers show
them what you can do until then stay clear of
archery are you any good at trapping
i know a few basic snares i mutter
that may be significant in terms of food says
haymitch and peeta shes right never
underestimate strength in the arena very often
physical power tilts the advantage to a player in the
training center they will have weights but dont
reveal how much you can lift in front of the other
tributes the plans the same for both of you you go
to group training spend the time trying to learn
something you dont know throw a spear swing a
mace learn to tie a decent knot save showing what
youre best at until your private sessions are we
clear says haymitch peeta and i nod

one last thing in public i want you by each others
side every minute says haymitch we both start to
object but haymitch slams his hand on the table
every minute its not open for discussion you
agreed to do as i said you will be together you will
appear amiable to each other now get out meet effie
at the elevator at ten for training
i bite my lip and stalk back to my room making sure
peeta can hear the door slam i sit on the bed hating
haymitch hating peeta hating myself for mentioning
that day long ago in the rain
its such a joke peeta and i going along pretending to
be friends talking up each others strengths
insisting the other take credit for their abilities
because in fact at some point were going to have to
knock it off and accept were bitter adversaries which
id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for
haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together
in training its my own fault i guess for telling him
he didnt have to coach us separately but that didnt
mean i wanted to do everything with peeta who by
the way clearly doesnt want to be partnering up with
me either
i hear peetas voice in my head she has no idea the
effect she can have obviously meant to demean me
right but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a
compliment that he meant i was appealing in some
way its weird how much hes noticed me like the
attention hes paid to my hunting and apparently i
have not been as oblivious to him as i imagined
either the flour the wrestling i have kept track of
the boy with the bread
its almost ten i clean my teeth and smooth back my
hair again anger temporarily blocked out my
nervousness about meeting the other tributes but

now i can feel my anxiety rising again by the time i
meet effie and peeta at the elevator i catch myself
biting my nails i stop at once
the actual training rooms are below ground level of
our building with these elevators the ride is less
than a minute the doors open into an enormous
gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle
courses although its not yet ten were the last ones
to arrive the other tributes are gathered in a tense
circle they each have a cloth square with their
district number on it pinned to their shirts while
someone pins the number 12 on my back i do a quick
assessment peeta and i are the only two dressed
alike
as soon as we join the circle the head trainer a tall
athletic woman named atala steps up and begins to
explain the training schedule experts in each skill
will remain at their stations we will be free to travel
from area to area as we choose per our mentors
instructions some of the stations teach survival
skills others fighting techniques we are forbidden to
engage in any combative exercise with another
tribute there are assistants on hand if we want to
practice with a partner
when atala begins to read down the list of the skill
stations my eyes cant help flitting around to the
other tributes its the first time weve been
assembled on level ground in simple clothes my
heart sinks almost all of the boys and at least half of
the girls are bigger than i am even though many of
the tributes have never been fed properly you can see
it in their bones their skin the hollow look in their
eyes i may be smaller naturally but overall my
familys resourcefulness has given me an edge in that
area i stand straight and while im thin im strong
the meat and plants from the woods combined with

the exertion it took to get them have given me a
healthier body than most of those i see around me
the exceptions are the kids from the wealthier
districts the volunteers the ones who have been fed
and trained throughout their lives for this moment
the tributes from 12 and 4 traditionally have this
look about them its technically against the rules to
train tributes before they reach the capitol but it
happens every year in district 12 we call them the
career tributes or just the careers and like as not
the winner will be one of them
the slight advantage i held coming into the training
center my fiery entrance last night seems to vanish
in the presence of my competition the other tributes
were jealous of us but not because we were amazing
because our stylists were now i see nothing but
contempt in the glances of the career tributes each
must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me they
project arrogance and brutality when atala releases
us they head straight for the deadliestlooking
weapons in the gym and handle them with ease
im thinking that its lucky im a fast runner when
peeta nudges my arm and i jump he is still beside
me per haymitchs instructions his expression is
sober where would you like to start
i look around at the career tributes who are showing
off clearly trying to intimidate the field then at the
others the underfed the incompetent shakily having
their first lessons with a knife or an ax
suppose we tie some knots i say
right you are says peeta we cross to an empty
station where the trainer seems pleased to have
students you get the feeling that the knottying class

is not the hunger games hot spot when he realizes i
know something about snares he shows us a simple
excellent trap that will leave a human competitor
dangling by a leg from a tree we concentrate on this
one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered
it then we move on to camouflage peeta genuinely
seems to enjoy this station swirling a combination of
mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale
skin weaving disguises from vines and leaves the
trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of
enthusiasm at his work
i do the cakes he admits to me
the cakes i ask ive been preoccupied with
watching the boy from district 2 send a spear
through a dummys heart from fifteen yards what
cakes
at home the iced ones for the bakery he says
he means the ones they display in the windows
fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in
frosting theyre for birthdays and new years day
when were in the square prim always drags me over
to admire them although wed never be able to afford
one theres little enough beauty in district 12
though so i can hardly deny her this
i look more critically at the design on peetas arm the
alternating pattern of light and dark suggests
sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods i
wonder how he knows this since i doubt hes ever
been beyond the fence has he been able to pick this
up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his
backyard somehow the whole thing — his skill
those inaccessible cakes the praise of the camouflage
expert — annoys me

its lovely if only you could frost someone to deathi
say
dont be so superior you can never tell what you 11
find in the arena say its actually a gigantic cake —
begins peeta
say we move on i break in
so the next three days pass with peeta and i going
quietly from station to station we do pick up some
valuable skills from starting fires to knife throwing
to making shelter despite haymitchs order to appear
mediocre peeta excels in handtohand combat and i
sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye
we steer clear of archery and weightlifting though
wanting to save those for our private sessions
the gamemakers appeared early on the first day
twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple
robes they sit in the elevated stands that surround
the gymnasium sometimes wandering about to watch
us jotting down notes other times eating at the
endless banquet that has been set for them ignoring
the lot of us but they do seem to be keeping their eye
on the district 12 tributes several times ive looked
up to find one fixated on me they consult with the
trainers during our meals as well we see them all
gathered together when we come back
breakfast and dinner are served on our floor but at
lunch the twentyfour of us eat in a dining room off
the gymnasium food is arranged on carts around the
room and you serve yourself the career tributes
tend to gather rowdily around one table as if to prove
their superiority that they have no fear of one
another and consider the rest of us beneath notice
most of the other tributes sit alone like lost sheep no
one says a word to us peeta and i eat together and

since haymitch keeps dogging us about it try to keep
up a friendly conversation during the meals
its not easy to find a topic talking of home is
painful talking of the present unbearable one day
peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how
they have been careful to include types from the
districts along with the refined bread of the capitol
the fishshaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from
district 4 the crescent moon roll dotted with seeds
from district 1 1  somehow although its made from
the same stuff it looks a lot more appetizing than the
ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home
and there you have it says peeta scooping the
breads back in the basket
you certainly know a lot i say
only about bread he says okay now laugh as if
ive said something funny
we both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore
the stares from around the room
all right ill keep smiling pleasantly and you
talksays peeta its wearing us both out haymitch s
direction to be friendly because ever since i slammed
my door theres been a chill in the air between us
but we have our orders
did i ever tell you about the time i was chased by a
bear i ask
no but it sounds fascinating says peeta
i try and animate my face as i recall the event a true
story in which id foolishly challenged a black bear
over the rights to a beehive peeta laughs and asks

questions right on cue hes much better at this than
i am
on the second day while were taking a shot at spear
throwing he whispers to me i think we have a
shadow
i throw my spear which im not too bad at actually if
i dont have to throw too far and see the little girl
from district 1 1 standing back a bit watching us
shes the twelveyearold the one who reminded me
so of prim in stature up close she looks about ten
she has bright dark eyes and satiny brown skin and
stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly
extended to her sides as if ready to take wing at the
slightest sound its impossible not to think of a bird
i pick up another spear while peeta throws i think
her names rue he says softly
i bite my lip rue is a small yellow flower that grows
in the meadow rue primrose neither of them could
tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet
what can we do about it i ask him more harshly
than i intended
nothing to do he says back just making
conversation
now that i know shes there its hard to ignore the
child she slips up and joins us at different stations
like me shes clever with plants climbs swiftly and
has good aim she can hit the target every time with a
slingshot but what is a slingshot against a 220
pound male with a sword
back on the district 12 floor haymitch and effie grill
us throughout breakfast and dinner about every

moment of the day what we did who watched us
how the other tributes size up cinna and portia
arent around so theres no one to add any sanity to
the meals not that haymitch and effie are fighting
anymore instead they seem to be of one mind
determined to whip us into shape full of endless
directions about what we should do and not do in
training peeta is more patient but i become fed up
and surly
when we finally escape to bed on the second night
peeta mumbles someone ought to get haymitch a
drink
i make a sound that is somewhere between a snort
and a laugh then catch myself its messing with my
mind too much trying to keep straight when were
supposedly friends and when were not at least when
we get into the arena 111 know where we stand
dont dont lets pretend when theres no one
around
all right katniss he says tiredly after that we only
talk in front of people
on the third day of training they start to call us out
of lunch for our private sessions with the
gamemakers district by district first the boy then
the girl tribute as usual district 12 is slated to go
last we linger in the dining room unsure where else
to go no one comes back once they have left as the
room empties the pressure to appear friendly
lightens by the time they call rue we are left alone
we sit in silence until they summon peeta he rises
remember what haymitch said about being sure to
throw the weights the words come out of my mouth
without permission

thanks i will he says you  shoot straight
i nod i dont know why i said anything at all
although if im going to lose id rather peeta win than
the others better for our district for my mother and
prim
after about fifteen minutes they call my name i
smooth my hair set my shoulders back and walk
into the gymnasium instantly i know im in trouble
theyve been here too long the gamemakers sat
through twentythree other demonstrations had too
much to wine most of them want more than
anything to go home
theres nothing i can do but continue with the plan i
walk to the archery station oh the weapons ive
been itching to get my hands on them for days bows
made of wood and plastic and metal and materials i
cant even name arrows with feathers cut in flawless
uniform lines i choose a bow string it and sling the
matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder theres
a shooting range but its much too limited standard
bullseyes and human silhouettes i walk to the
center of the gymnasium and pick my first target the
dummy used for knife practice even as i pull back on
the bow i know something is wrong the strings
tighter than the one i use at home the arrows more
rigid i miss the dummy by a couple of inches and
lose what little attention i had been commanding for
a moment im humiliated then i head back to the
bullseye i shoot again and again until i get the feel
of these new weapons
back in the center of the gymnasium i take my initial
position and skewer the dummy right through the
heart then i sever the rope that holds the sandbag
for boxing and the bag splits open as it slams to the
ground without pausing i shoulderroll forward

come up on one knee and send an arrow into one of
the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor a
shower of sparks bursts from the fixture
its excellent shooting i turn to the gamemakers a
few are nodding approval but the majority of them
are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their
banquet table
suddenly i am furious that with my life on the line
they dont even have the decency to pay attention to
me that im being upstaged by a dead pig my heart
starts to pound i can feel my face burning without
thinking i pull an arrow from my quiver and send it
straight at the gamemakers table i hear shouts of
alarm as people stumble back the arrow skewers the
apple in the pigs mouth and pins it to the wall
behind it everyone stares at me in disbelief
thank you for your consideration i say then i give
a slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without
being dismissed

3
as i stride toward the elevator i fling my bow to one
side and my quiver to the other i brush past the
gaping avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the
number twelve button with my fist the doors slide
together and i zip upward i actually make it back to
my floor before the tears start running down my
cheeks i can hear the others calling me from the
sitting room but i fly down the hall into my room
bolt the door and fling myself onto my bed then i
really begin to sob
now ive done it now ive ruined everything if id
stood even a ghost of chance it vanished when i sent
that arrow flying at the gamemakers what will they
do to me now arrest me execute me cut my
tongue and turn me into an avox so i can wait on the
future tributes of panem what was i thinking
shooting at the gamemakers of course i wasnt i
was shooting at that apple because i was so angry at
being ignored i wasnt trying to kill one of them if i
were theyd be dead
oh what does it matter its not like i was going to
win the games anyway who cares what they do to
me what really scares me is what they might do to
my mother and prim how my family might suffer now
because of my impulsiveness will they take their few
belongings or send my mother to prison and prim to
the community home or kill them they wouldnt kill
them would they why not what do they care
i should have stayed and apologized or laughed like
it was a big joke then maybe i would have found

some leniency but instead i stalked out of the place
in the most disrespectful manner possible
haymitch and effie are knocking on my door i shout
for them to go away and eventually they do it takes
at least an hour for me to cry myself out then i just
lay curled up on the bed stroking the silken sheets
watching the sun set over the artificial candy capitol
at first i expect guards to come for me but as time
passes it seems less likely i calm down they still
need a girl tribute from district 12 dont they if the
gamemakers want to punish me they can do it
publicly wait until im in the arena and sic starving
wild animals on me you can bet theyll make sure i
dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself
before that though theyll give me a score so low no
one in their right mind would sponsor me thats
what will happen tonight since the training isnt
open to viewers the gamemakers announce a score
for each player it gives the audience a starting place
for the betting that will continue throughout the
games the number which is between one and
twelve one being irredeemably bad and twelve being
unattainably high signifies the promise of the tribute
the mark is not a guarantee of which person will win
its only an indication of the potential a tribute
showed in training often because of the variables in
the actual arena highscoring tributes go down
almost immediately and a few years ago the boy who
won the games only received a three still the scores
can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of
sponsorship i had been hoping my shooting skills
might get me a six or a seven even if im not
particularly powerful now im sure 111 have the
lowest score of the twentyfour if no one sponsors
me my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero

when effie taps on the door to call me to dinner i
decide i may as well go the scores will be televised
tonight its not like i can hide what happened forever
i go to the bathroom and wash my face but its still
red and splotchy
everyones waiting at the table even cinna and
portia i wish the stylists hadnt shown up because
for some reason i dont like the idea of disappointing
them its as if ive thrown away all the good work
they did on the opening ceremonies without a
thought i avoid looking at anyone as i take tiny
spoonfuls of fish soup the saltiness reminds me of
my tears
the adults begin some chitchat about the weather
forecast and i let my eyes meet peetas he raises his
eyebrows a question what happened i just give my
head a small shake then as theyre serving the main
course i hear haymitch say okay enough small
talk just how bad were you today
peeta jumps in i dont know that it mattered by the
time i showed up no one even bothered to look at me
they were singing some kind of drinking song i
think so i threw around some heavy objects until
they told me i could go
that makes me feel a bit better its not like peeta
attacked the gamemakers but at least he was
provoked too
and you sweetheart says haymitch
somehow haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me
off enough that im at least able to speak i shot an
arrow at the gamemakers

everyone stops eating you what the horror in
effies voice confirms my worse suspicions
i shot an arrow at them not exactly at them in their
direction its like peeta said i was shooting and they
were ignoring me and i just  i just lost my head so i
shot an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth i
say defiantly
and what did they say says cinna carefully
nothing or i dont know i walked out after that i
say
without being dismissed gasps effie
i dismissed myself i said i remember how i
promised prim that i really would try to win and i feel
like a ton of coal has dropped on me
well thats thatsays haymitch then he butters a
roll
do you think they 11 arrest me i ask doubt it be a
pain to replace you at this stage says haymitch
what about my familyisay will they punish
them
dont think so wouldnt make much sense see
theyd have to reveal what happened in the training
center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the
population people would need to know what you did
but they cant since its secret so itd be a waste of
effort says haymitch more likely theyll make your
life hell in the arena
well theyve already promised to do that to us any
way says peeta

very true says haymitch and i realize the
impossible has happened they have actually cheered
me up haymitch picks up a pork chop with his
fingers which makes effie frown and dunks it in his
wine he rips off a hunk of meat and starts to
chuckle what were their faces like
i can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up shocked
terrified uh ridiculous some of them an image
pops into my mind one man tripped backward into
a bowl of punch
haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except
effie although even she is suppressing a smile well
it serves them right its their job to pay attention to
you and just because you come from district twelve
is no excuse to ignore you then her eyes dart
around as if shes said something totally
outrageous im sorry but thats what i think she
says to no one in particular
ill get a very bad score i say
scores only matter if theyre very good no one pays
much attention to the bad or mediocre ones for all
they know you could be hiding your talents to get a
low score on purpose people use that strategy said
portia
i hope thats how people interpret the four ill
probably get says peeta if that really is anything
less impressive than watching a person pick up a
heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards one almost
landed on my foot
i grin at him and realize that im starving i cut off a
piece of pork dunk it in mashed potatoes and start
eating its okay my family is safe and if they are
safe no real harm has been done

after dinner we go to sitting room to watch the scores
announced on television first they show a photo of
the tribute then flash their score below it the career
tributes naturally get in the eighttoten range most
of the other players average a five surprisingly little
rue comes up with a seven i dont know what she
showed the judges but shes so tiny it must have
been impressive
district 12 comes up last as usual peeta pulls an
eight so at least a couple of the gamemakers must
have been watching him i dig my fingernails into my
palms as my face comes up expecting the worst
then theyre flashing the number eleven on the
screen
eleven
effie trinket lets out a squeal and everybody is
slapping me on the back and cheering and
congratulating me but it doesnt seem real
there must be a mistake how  how could that
happen i ask haymitch
guess they liked your temper he says theyve got
a show to put on they need some players with some
heat
katniss the girl who was on fire says cinna and
gives me a hug oh wait until you see your interview
dress more flames i ask of a sort he says
mischievously
peeta and i congratulate each other another awkward
moment weve both done well but what does that
mean for the other i escape to my room as quickly as
possible and burrow down under the covers the
stress of the day particularly the crying has worn me

out i drift off reprieved relieved and with the
number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids
at dawn i lie in bed for a while watching the sun
come up on a beautiful morning its sunday a day
off at home i wonder if gale is in the woods yet
usually we devote all of sunday to stocking up for the
week rising early hunting and gathering then
trading at the hob i think of gale without me both
of us can hunt alone but were better as a pair
particularly if were trying for bigger game but also in
the littler things having a partner lightened the load
could even make the arduous task of filling my
familys table enjoyable
i had been struggling along on my own for about six
months when i first ran into gale in the woods it was
a sunday in october the air cool and pungent with
dying things id spent the morning competing with
the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer
afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting
katniss the only meat id shot was a squirrel that
had practically run over my toes in its quest for
acorns but the animals would still be afoot when the
snow buried my other food sources having strayed
farther afield than usual i was hurrying back home
lugging my burlap sacks when i came across a dead
rabbit it was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot
above my head about fifteen yards away was
another i recognized the twitchup snares because
my father had used them when the prey is caught
its yanked into the air out of the reach of other
hungry animals id been trying to use snares all
summer with no success so i couldnt help dropping
my sacks to examine this one my fingers were just on
the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang
out thats dangerous

i jumped back several feet as gale materialized from
behind a tree he must have been watching me the
whole time he was only fourteen but he cleared six
feet and was as good as an adult to me id seen him
around the seam and at school and one other time
hed lost his father in the same blast that killed mine
in january id stood by while he received his medal
of valor in the justice building another oldest child
with no father i remembered his two little brothers
clutching his mother a woman whose swollen belly
announced she was just days away from giving birth
whats your name he said coming over and
disengaging the rabbit from the snare he had
another three hanging from his belt
katniss i said barely audible
well catnip stealings punishable by death or
hadnt you heard he said
katniss i said louder and i wasnt stealing it i
just wanted to look at your snare mine never catch
anything
he scowled at me not convinced so whered you get
the squirrel
i shot it i pulled my bow off my shoulder i was still
using the small version my father had made me but
id been practicing with the fullsize one when i could
i was hoping that by spring i might be able to bring
down some bigger game
gales eyes fastened on the bow can i see that i
handed it over just remember stealings punishable
by death

that was the first time i ever saw him smile it
transformed him from someone menacing to someone
you wished you knew but it took several months
before i returned that smile
we talked hunting then i told him i might be able to
get him a bow if he had something to trade not food
i wanted knowledge i wanted to set my own snares
that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day he agreed
something might be worked out as the seasons went
by we grudgingly began to share our knowledge our
weapons our secret places that were thick with wild
plums or turkeys he taught me snares and fishing i
showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave
him one of our precious bows and then one day
without either of us saying it we became a team
dividing the work and the spoils making sure that
both our families had food
gale gave me a sense of securityldlacked since my
fathers death his companionship replaced the long
solitary hours in the woods i became a much better
hunter when i didnt have to look over my shoulder
constantly when someone was watching my back
but he turned into so much more than a hunting
partner he became my confidante someone with
whom i could share thoughts i could never voice
inside the fence in exchange he trusted me with his
being out in the woods with gale    sometimes i was
actually happy
i call him my friend but in the last year its seemed
too casual a word for what gale is to me a pang of
longing shoots through my chest if only he was with
me now but of course i dont want that i dont want
him in the arena where hed be dead in a few days i
just  i just miss him and i hate being so alone
does he miss me he must

i think of the eleven flashing under my name last
night i know exactly what hed say to me well
theres some room for improvement there and then
hed give me a smile and id return it without
hesitating now
i cant help comparing what i have with gale to what
im pretending to have with peeta how i never
question gales motives while i do nothing but doubt
the latters its not a fair comparison really gale and
i were thrown together by a mutual need to survive
peeta and i know the others survival means our own
death how do you sidestep that
effies knocking at the door reminding me theres
another big big big day ahead tomorrow night
will be our televised interviews i guess the whole
team will have their hands full readying us for that
i get up and take a quick shower being a bit more
careful about the buttons i hit and head down to the
dining room peeta effie and haymitch are huddled
around the table talking in hushed voices that
seems odd but hunger wins out over curiosity and i
load up my plate with breakfast before i join them
the stews made with tender chunks of lamb and
dried plums today perfect on the bed of wild rice ive
shoveled about halfway through the mound when i
realize no ones talking i take a big gulp of orange
juice and wipe my mouth so whats going on
youre coaching us on interviews today right
thats right says haymitch
you dont have to wait until im done i can listen
and cat at the same time i say

well theres been a change of plans about our
current approach says haymitch
whats that i ask im not sure what our current
approach is trying to appear mediocre in front of the
other tributes is the last bit of strategy i remember
haymitch shrugs peeta has asked to be coached
separately

betrayal thats the first thing i feel which is
ludicrous for there to be betrayal there would have
had to been trust first between peeta and me and
trust has not been part of the agreement were
tributes but the boy who risked a beating to give me
bread the one who steadied me in the chariot who
covered for me with the redheaded avox girl who
insisted haymitch know my hunting skills    was
there some part of me that couldnt help trusting
him
on the other hand im relieved that we can stop the
pretense of being friends obviously whatever thin
connection wed foolishly formed has been severed
and high time too the games begin in two days and
trust will only be a weakness whatever triggered
peetas decision — and i suspect it had to do with my
outperforming him in training — i should be nothing
but grateful for it maybe hes finally accepted the fact
that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are
enemies the better
good i say so whats the schedule
youll each have four hours with effie for
presentation and four with me for content says
haymitch you start with effie katniss
i cant imagine what effie will have to teach me that
could take four hours but shes got me working down
to the last minute we go to my rooms and she puts
me inafulllength gown and highheeled shoes not
the ones ill he wearing for the actual interview and
instructs me on walking the shoes are the worst

part ive never worn high heels and cant get used to
essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet
but effie runs around in them fulltime and im
determined that if she can do it so can i the dress
poses another problem it keeps tangling around my
shoes so of course i hitch it up and then effie
swoops down on me like a hawk smacking my hands
and yelling not above the ankle when i finally
conquer walking theres still sitting posture —
apparently i have a tendency to duck my head — eye
contact hand gestures and smiling smiling is
mostly about smiling more effie makes me say a
hundred banal phrases starting with a smile while
smiling or ending with a smile by lunch the
muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse
well thats the best i can do effie says with a sigh
just remember katniss you want the audience to
like you
and you dont think they will i ask
not if you glare at them the entire time why dont
you save that for the arena instead think of yourself
among friends says effie
theyre betting on how long ill live i burst
out theyre not my friends
well try and pretend snaps effie then she
composes herself and beams at me see like this im
smiling at you even though youre aggravating me
yes it feels very convincing i say im going to eat
1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining
room hiking my skirt up to my thighs
peeta and haymitch seem in pretty good moods so
im thinking the content session should be an

improvement over the morning i couldnt be more
wrong after lunch haymitch takes me into the
sitting room directs me to the couch and then just
frowns at me for a while
what i finally ask
im trying to figure out what to do with you he
says how were going to present you are you going
to be charming aloof fierce so far youre shining
like a star you volunteered to save your sister cinna
made you look unforgettable youve got the top
training score people are intrigued but no one knows
who you are the impression you make tomorrow will
decide exactly what i can get you in terms of
sponsors says haymitch
having watched the tribute interviews all my life i
know theres truth to what hes saying if you appeal
to the crowd either by being humorous or brutal or
eccentric you gain favor
whats peetas approach or am i not allowed to
ask i say
likable he has a sort of selfdeprecating humor
naturally says haymitch whereas when you open
your mouth you come across more as sullen and
hostile
i do not i say
please i dont know where you pulled that cheery
wavy girl on the chariot from but i havent seen her
before or since says haymitch
and youve given me so many reasons to be cheery i
counter
ill  p a g e
but you dont have to please me im not going to
sponsor you so pretend im the audience says
haymitch delight me
fine i snarl haymitch takes the role of the
interviewer and i try to answer his questions in a
winning fashion but i cant im too angry with
haymitch for what he said and that i even have to
answer the questions all i can think is how unjust
the whole thing is the hunger games why am i
hopping around like some trained dog trying to please
people i hate the longer the interview goes on the
more my fury seems to rise to the surface until im
literally spitting out answers at him
all right enough he says weve got to find another
angle not only are you hostile i dont know anything
about you ive asked you fifty questions and still have
no sense of your life your family what you care
about they want to know about you katniss
but i dont want them to theyre already taking my
future they cant have the things that mattered to
me in the past i say
then lie make something up says haymitch
im not good at lying i say
well you better learn fast youve got about as much
charm as a dead slug says haymitch
ouch that hurts even haymitch must know hes
been too harsh because his voice softens heres an
idea try acting humble
humble i echo

that you cant believe a little girl from district twelve
has done this well the whole things been more than
you ever could have dreamed of talk about cinnas
clothes how nice the people are how the city amazes
you if you wont talk about yourself at least
compliment the audience just keep turning it back
around all right gush
the next hours are agonizing at once its clear i
cannot gush we try me playing cocky but i just dont
have the arrogance apparently im too vulnerable
for ferocity im not witty funny sexy or
mysterious
by the end of the session i am no one at all
haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty
and a nasty edge has crept into his voice i give up
sweetheart just answer the questions and try not to
let the audience see how openly you despise them
i have dinner that night in my room ordering an
outrageous number of delicacies eating myself sick
and then taking out my anger at haymitch at the
hunger games at every living being in the capitol by
smashing dishes around my room when the girl with
the red hair comes in to turn down my bed her eyes
widen at the mess just leave it i yell at her just
leave it alone
i hate her too with her knowing reproachful eyes
that call me a coward a monster a puppet of the
capitol both now and then for her justice must
finally be happening at least my death will help pay
for the life of the boy in the woods
but instead of fleeing the room the girl closes the
door behind her and goes to the bathroom she comes
back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently

then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my
hands why is she doing this why am i letting her
i should have tried to save you i whisper
she shakes her head does this mean we were right to
stand by that she has forgiven me
no it was wrong i say
she taps her lips with her fingers then points to my
chest i think she means that i would just have ended
up an avox too probably would have an avox or
dead
i spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl
clean the room when all the garbage has been
dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away
she turns down my bed i crawl in between the sheets
like a fiveyearold and let her tuck me in then she
goes i want her to stay until i fall asleep to be there
when i wake up i want the protection of this girl
even though she never had mine
in the morning its not the girl but my prep team who
are hanging over me my lessons with effie and
haymitch are over this day belongs to cinna hes
my last hope maybe he can make me look so
wonderful no one will care what comes out of my
mouth
the team works on me until late afternoon turning
my skin to glowing satin stenciling patterns on my
arms painting flame designs on my twenty perfect
nails then venia goes to work on my hair weaving
strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left
ear wraps around my head and then falls in one
braid down my right shoulder they erase my face
with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features

back out huge dark eyes full red lips lashes that
throw off bits of light when i blink finally they cover
my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer
in gold dust
then cinna enters with what i assume is my dress
but i cant really see it because its covered close
your eyes he orders
i can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over
my naked body then the weight it must be forty
pounds i clutch octavias hand as i blindly step into
my shoes glad to find they are at least two inches
lower than the pair effie had me practice in theres
some adjusting and fidgeting then silence
can i open my eyes i ask
yes says cinna open them
the creature standing before me in the fulllength
mirror has come from another world where skin
shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make
their clothes from jewels because my dress oh my
dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems
red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent
the tips of the flame design the slightest movement
gives the impression i am engulfed in tongues of fire
i am not pretty i am not beautiful i am as radiant as
the sun
for a while we all just stare at me oh cinna i
finally whisper thank you
twirl for me he says i hold out my arms and spin
in a circle the prep team screams in admiration

cinna dismisses the team and has me move around
in the dress and shoes which are infinitely more
manageable than effies the dress hangs in such a
way that i dont have to lift the skirt when i walk
leaving me with one less thing to worry about
so all ready for the interview then asks cinna i
can see by his expression that hes been talking to
haymitch that he knows how dreadful i am
im awful haymitch called me a dead slug no
matter what we tried i couldnt do it i just cant be
one of those people he wants me to be i say
cinna thinks about this a moment why dont you
just be yourself
myself thats no good either haymitch says im
sullen and hostile i say
well you are  around haymitch says cinna with
a grin i dont find you so the prep team adores you
you even won over the gamemakers and as for the
citizens of the capitol well they cant stop talking
about you no one can help but admire your spirit
my spirit this is a new thought im not sure exactly
what it means but it suggests im a fighter in a sort
of brave way its not as if im never friendly okay
maybe i dont go around loving everybody i meet
maybe my smiles are hard to come by but i do care
for some people
cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones
suppose when you answer the questions you think
youre addressing a friend back home who would
your best friend be asks cinna

gale i say instantly only it doesnt make sense
cinna i would never be telling gale those things
about me he already knows them
what about me could you think of me as a friend
asks cinna
of all the people ive met since i left home cinna is
by far my favorite i liked him right off and he hasnt
disappointed me yet i think so but —
ill be sitting on the main platform with the other
stylists youll be able to look right at me when
youre asked a question find me and answer it as
honestly as possible says cinna
even if what i think is horrible i ask because it
might be really
especially if what you think is horrible says
cinna youll try it
i nod its a plan or at least a straw to grasp at
too soon its time to go the interviews take place on
a stage constructed in front of the training center
once i leave my room it will be only minutes until im
in front of the crowd the cameras all of panem
as cinna turns the doorknob i stop his hand cinna
 im completely overcome with stage fright
remember they already love you he says gently
just be yourself
we meet up with the rest of the district 12 crowd at
the elevator portia and her gang have been hard at
work peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame
accents while we look well together its a relief not to

be dressed identically haymitch and effie are all
fancied up for the occasion i avoid haymitch but
accept effie s compliments effie can be tiresome and
clueless but shes not destructive like haymitch
when the elevator opens the other tributes are being
lined up to take the stage all twentyfour of us sit in
a big arc throughout the interviews ill be last or
second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy
from each district how i wish i could be first and get
the whole thing out of the way now 111 have to listen
to how witty funny humble fierce and charming
everybody else is before i go up plus the audience
will start to get bored just as the gamemakers did
and i cant exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to
get their attention
right before we parade onto the stage haymitch
comes up behind peeta and me and growls
remember youre still a happy pair so act like it
what i thought we abandoned that when peeta
asked for separate coaching but i guess that was a
private not a public thing anyway theres not much
chance for interaction now as we walk singlefile to
our seats and take our places
just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid
and shallow i can feel my pulse pounding in my
temples its a relief to get to my chair because
between the heels and my legs shaking im afraid ill
trip although evening is falling the city circle is
brighter than a summers day an elevated seating
unit has been set up for prestigious guests with the
stylists commanding the front row the cameras will
turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their
handiwork a large balcony off a building to the right
has been reserved for the gamemakers television
crews have claimed most of the other balconies but

the city circle and the avenues that feed into it are
completely packed with people standing room only
at homes and community halls around the country
every television set is turned on every citizen of
panem is tuned in there will be no blackouts tonight
caesar flickerman the man who has hosted the
interviews for more than forty years bounces onto the
stage its a little scary because his appearance has
been virtually unchanged during all that time same
face under a coating of pure white makeup same
hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each
hunger games same ceremonial suit midnight blue
dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that
twinkle like stars they do surgery in the capitol to
make people appear younger and thinner in district
12 looking old is something of an achievement since
so many people die early you see an elderly person
you want to congratulate them on their longevity ask
the secret of survival a plump person is envied
because they arent scraping by like the majority of
us but here it is different wrinkles arent desirable
a round belly isnt a sign of success
this year caesars hair is powder blue and his
eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue he looks
freakish but less frightening than he did last year
when his color was crimson and he seemed to be
bleeding caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the
audience but then gets down to business
the girl tribute from district 1  looking provocative in
a seethrough gold gown steps up the center of the
stage to join caesar for her interview you can tell her
mentor didnt have any trouble coming up with an
angle for her with that flowing blonde hair emerald
green eyes her body tall and lush  shes sexy all the
way

each interview only lasts three minutes then a
buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up ill say this
for caesar he really does his best to make the
tributes shine hes friendly tries to set the nervous
ones at ease laughs at lame jokes and can turn a
weak response into a memorable one by the way he
reacts
i sit like a lady the way effie showed me as the
districts slip by 2 3 4 everyone seems to be playing
up some angle the monstrous boy from district 2 is
a ruthless killing machine the foxfaced girl from
district 5 sly and elusive i spotted cinna as soon as
he took his place but even his presence cannot relax
me 8 9 10 the crippled boy from 10 is very quiet
my palms are sweating like crazy but the jeweled
dress isnt absorbent and they skid right of if i try to
dry them 1 1
rue who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete
with wings flutters her way to caesar a hush falls
over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a
tribute caesars very sweet with her complimenting
her seven in training an excellent score for one so
small when he asks her what her greatest strength
in the arena will be she doesnt hesitate im very
hard to catch she says in a tremulous voice and if
they cant catch me they cant kill me so dont count
me out
i wouldnt in a million years says caesar
encouragingly
the boy tribute from district 1 1  thresh has the
same dark skin as rue but the resemblance stops
there hes one of the giants probably six and a half
feet tall and built like an ox but i noticed he rejected
the invitations from the career tributes to join their
crowd instead hes been very solitary speaking to no

one showing little interest in training even so he
scored a ten and its not hard to imagine he
impressed the gamemakers he ignores caesars
attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or
just remains silent
if only i was his size i could get away with sullen and
hostile and it would be just fine i bet half the
sponsors are at least considering him if i had any
money id bet on him myself
and then theyre calling katniss everdeen and i feel
myself as if in a dream standing and making my way
center stage i shake caesars outstretched hand and
he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off
on his suit
so katniss the capitol must be quite a change from
district twelve whats impressed you most since you
arrived hereasks caesar
what what did he say its as if the words make no
sense
my mouth has gone as dry as sawdust i desperately
find cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him i
imagine the words coming from his lips whats
impressed you most since you arrived here i rack
my brain for something that made me happy here be
honest i think be honest
the lamb stew i get out
caesar laughs and vaguely i realize some of the
audience has joined in
the one with the dried plums asks caesar i nod
oh i eat it by the bucketful he turns sideways to
the audience in horror hand on his stomach it

doesnt show does it they shout reassurances to
him and applaud this is what i mean about caesar
he tries to help you out
now katniss he says confidentially when you
came out in the opening ceremonies my heart
actually stopped what did you think of that
costume
cinna raises one eyebrow at me be honest you
mean after i got over my fear of being burned alive i
ask
big laugh a real one from the audience
yes start then says caesar
cinna my friend i should tellhimanywayi thought
cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous
costume id ever seen and i couldnt believe i was
wearing it i cant believe im wearing this either i
lift up my skirt to spread it out i mean look at it
as the audience oohs and ahs i see cinna make the
tiniest circular motion with his finger but i know
what hes saying twirl for me
i spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate
oh do that again says caesar and so i lift up my
arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly
out letting the dress engulf me in flames the
audience breaks into cheers when i stop i clutch
caesars arm
dont stop he says

i have to im dizzy im also giggling which i think
ive done maybe never in my lifetime but the nerves
and the spinning have gotten to me
caesar wraps a protective arm around me dont
worry ive got you cant have you following in your
mentors footsteps
everyones hooting as the cameras find haymitch
who is by now famous for his head dive at the
reaping and he waves them away goodnaturedly and
points back to me
its all right caesar reassures the crowd shes safe
with me so how about that training score eleven
give us a hint what happened in there
i glance at the gamemakers on the balcony and bite
my lip um  all i can say is i think it was a first
the cameras are right on the gamemakers who are
chuckling and nodding
youre killing us says caesar as if in actual
pain details details
i address the balcony im not supposed to talk about
it right
the gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts
outshes not
thank you i say sorry my lips are sealed
lets go back then to the moment they called your
sisters name at the reaping says caesar his mood
is quieter now and you volunteered can you tell us
about her

no no not all of you but maybe cinna i dont think
im imagining the sadness on his face her names
prim shes just twelve and i love her more than
anything
you could hear a pin drop in the city circle now
what did she say to you after the reaping caesar
asks
be honest be honest i swallow hard she asked me
to try really hard to win the audience is frozen
hanging on my every word
and what did you say prompts caesar gently
but instead of warmth i feel an icy rigidity take over
my body my muscles tense as they do before a kill
when i speak my voice seems to have dropped an
octave i swore i would
i bet you did says caesar giving me a squeeze the
buzzer goes off sorry were out of time best of luck
katniss everdeen tribute from district twelve
the applause continues long after im seated i look to
cinna for reassurance he gives me a subtle thumbs
up
im still in a daze for the first part of peetas interview
he has the audience from the getgo though i can
hear them laughing shouting out he plays up the
bakers son thing comparing the tributes to the
breads from their districts then has a funny
anecdote about the perils of the capitol showers tell
me do i still smell like roses he asks caesar and
then theres a whole run where they take turns
sniffing each other that brings down the house im

coming back into focus when caesar asks him if he
has a girlfriend back home
peeta hesitates then gives an unconvincing shake of
his head
handsome lad like you there must be some special
girl come on whats her name says caesar
peeta sighs well there is this one girl ive had a
crush on her ever since i can remember but im
pretty sure she didnt know i was alive until the
reaping
sounds of sympathy from the crowd unrequited love
they can relate to
she have another fellow asks caesar
i dont know but a lot of boys like her says peeta
so heres what you do you win you go home she
cant turn you down then eh says caesar
encouragingly
i dont think its going to work out winning wont
help in my case says peeta
why ever not says caesar mystified
peeta blushes beet red and stammersout because
because she came here with me

parti
the games

10
for a moment the cameras hold on peetas downcast
eyes as what he says sinks in then i can see my face
mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest
magnified on every screen as i realize me he means
me i press my lips together and stare at the floor
hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil
up inside of me
oh that is a piece of bad luck says caesar and
theres a real edge of pain in his voice the crowd is
murmuring in agreement a few have even given
agonized cries
its not good agrees peeta
well i dont think any of us can blame you itd be
hard not to fall for that young lady says caesar
she didnt know
peeta shakes his head not until now
i allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long
enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is
unmistakable
wouldnt you love to pull her back out here and get a
response caesar asks the audience the crowd
screams assent sadly rules are rules and katniss
everdeens time has been spent well best of luck to
you peeta mellark and i think i speak for all of
panem when i say our hearts go with yours
the roar of the crowdis deafening peeta has
absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his

declaration of love for me when the audience finally
settles down he chokes out a quiet thank you and
returns to his seat we stand for the anthem i have
to raise my head out of the required respect and
cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now
dominated by a shot of peeta and me separated by a
few feet that in the viewers heads can never be
breached poor tragic us
but i know better
after the anthem the tributes file back into the
training center lobby and onto the elevators i make
sure to veer into a car that does not contain peeta
the crowd slows our entourages of stylists and
mentors and chaperones so we have only each other
for company no one speaks my elevator stops to
deposit four tributes before i am alone and then find
the doors opening on the twelfth floor peeta has only
just stepped from his car when i slam my palms into
his chest he loses his balance and crashes into an
ugly urn filled with fake flowers the urn tips and
shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces peeta lands in
the shards and blood immediately flows from his
hands
what was that for he says aghast
you had no right no right to go saying those things
about me i shout at him
now the elevators open and the whole crew is there
effie haymitch cinna and portia
whats going on says effie a note of hysteria in her
voice did you fall
after she shoved me says peeta aseffie and cinna
help him up

haymitch turns on me shoved him
this was your idea wasnt it turning me into some
kind of fool in front of the entire country i answer
it was my idea says peeta wincing as he pulls
spikes of pottery from his palms haymitch just
helped me with it
yes haymitch is very helpful to you i say
you are a fool haymitch says in disgust do you
think he hurt you that boy just gave you something
you could never achieve on your own
he made me look weak i say
he made you look desirable and lets face it you can
use all the help you can get in that department you
were about as romantic as dirt until he said he
wanted you now they all do youre all theyre talking
about the starcrossed lovers from district twelve
says haymitch
but were not starcrossed lovers i say
haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against
the wall who cares its all a big show its all how
youre perceived the most i could say about you after
your interview was that you were nice enough
although that in itself was a small miracle now i can
say youre a heartbreaker oh oh oh how the boys
back home fall longingly at your feet which do you
think will get you more sponsors
the smell of wine on his breath makes me sick i
shove his hands off my shoulders and step away
trying to clear my head

cinna comes over and puts his arm around me hes
right katniss
i dont know what to think i should have been told
so i didnt look so stupid
no your reaction was perfect if youd known it
wouldnt have read as real says portia
shes just worried about her boyfriend says peeta
gruffly tossing away a bloody piece of the urn
my cheeks burn again at the thought of gale i dont
have a boyfriend
whatever says peeta but i bet hes smart enough
to know a bluff when he sees it besides you didnt
say you loved me so what does it matter
the words are sinking in my anger fading im torn
now between thinking ive been used and thinking ive
been given an edge haymitch is right i survived my
interview but what was i really a silly girl spinning
in a sparkling dress giggling the only moment of
any substance i hail was when i talked about prim
compare that with thresh his silent deadly power
and im forgettable silly and sparkly and forgettable
no not entirely forgettable i have my eleven in
training
but now peeta has made me an object of love not
just his to hear him tell it i have many admirers
and iftheaudience really thinks were in love  i
remember howstrongly they responded to his
confession starcrossed lovers haymitch is right
they eat that stuff up in the capitol suddenly im
worried that i didnt react properly

after he said he loved me did you thinkl could be in
love with him too i ask
i did says portia the way you avoidedlooking at
the cameras the blush
they others chime in agreeing
youre golden sweetheart youre going to have
sponsors lined up around the block says haymitch
im embarrassed about my reaction i force myself to
acknowledge peeta im sorry i shoved you
doesnt matter he shrugs although its technically
illegal
are your hands okay i ask theyh be all right he
says
in the silence that follows delicious smells of our
dinner waft in from the dining room come on lets
eat says haymitch we all follow him to the table
and take our places but then peeta is bleeding too
heavily and portia leads him off for medical
treatment we start the cream and rosepetal soup
without them by the time weve finished theyre
back peetas hands are wrapped in bandages i cant
help feeling guilty tomorrow we will be in the arena
he has done me a favor and i have answered with an
injury will i never stop owing him
after dinner we watch the replay in the sitting room
i seem frilly and shallow twirling and giggling in my
dress although the others assure me i am charming
peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning
as the boy in loveandthere i am blushing and
confused madebeautiful by cinnas hands desirable

by peetas confession tragic by circumstance and by
all accounts unforgettable
when the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark
a hush falls on the room tomorrow at dawn we will
be roused and prepared for the arena the actual
games dont start until ten because so many of the
capitol residents rise late but peeta and i must make
an early start there is no telling how far we will
travel to the arena that has been prepared for this
years games
i know haymitch and effie will not be going with us
as soon as they leave here theyll be at the games
headquarters hopefully madly signing up our
sponsors working out a strategy on how and when to
deliver the gifts to us cinna and portia will travel
with us to the very spot from which we will be
launched into the arena still final goodbyes must be
said here
effie takes both of us by the hand and with actual
tears in her eyes wishes us well thanks us for being
the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to
sponsor and then because its effie and shes
apparently required by law to say something awful
she adds i wouldnt be at all surprised if i finally get
promoted to a decent district next year
then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries
out overcome with either the emotional parting or the
possible improvement of her fortunes
haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over
any final words of advice asks peeta
when the gong sounds get the hell out of there
youre neither of you up to the blood bath at the

cornucopia just clear out put as much distance as
you can between yourselves and the others and find
a source of water he says got it
and after that i ask
stay alive says haymitch its the same advice he
gave us on the train but hes not drunk and laughing
this time and we only nod what else is there to say
when i head to my room peeta lingers to talk to
portia im glad whatever strange words of parting we
exchange can wait until tomorrow my covers are
drawn back but there is no sign of the redheaded
avox girl i wish i knew her name i should have
asked it she could write it down maybe or act it out
but perhaps that would only result in punishment for
her
i take a shower and scrub the gold paint the
makeup the scent of beauty from my body all that
remains of the designteams efforts are the flames on
my nails i decide to keep them as reminder of who i
am to the audience katniss the girl who was on fire
perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the
days to come
i pull on a thick fleecy nightgown and climb into bed
it takes me about five seconds to realize ill never fall
asleep and i need sleep desperately because in the
arena every moment i give in to fatigue will be an
invitation to death
its no good one hour two three pass and my
eyelids refuse to get heavy i cant stop trying to
imagine exactly what terrain ill be thrown into
desert swamp a frigid wasteland above all i am
hoping for trees which may afford me some means of
concealment and food and shelter often there are

trees because barren landscapes are dull and the
games resolve too quickly without them but what
will the climate be like what traps have the
gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower
moments and then there are my fellow tributes
the more anxious i am to find sleep the more it
eludes me finally i am too restless to even stay in
bed i pace the floor heart beating too fast breathing
too short my room feels like a prison cell if i dont
get air soon im going to start to throw things again i
run down the hall to the door to the roof its not only
unlocked but ajar perhaps someone forgot to close it
but it doesnt matter the energy field enclosing the
roof prevents any desperate form of escape and im
not looking to escape only to fill my lungs with air i
want to see the sky and the moon on the last night
that no one will be hunting me
the roof is not lit at night but as soon as my bare feel
reach its tiled surface i see his silhouette black
against the lights that shine endlessly in the capitol
theres quite a commotion going on down in the
streets music and singing and car horns none of
which i could hear through the thick glass window
panels in my room i could slip away now without
him noticing me he wouldnt hear me over the din
but the night airs so sweet i cant bear returning to
that stuffy cage of a room and what difference does it
make whether we speak or not
my feet move soundlessly across the tiles im only
yard behind him when i say you should be getting
some sleep
he starts but doesnt turn i can see him give his
head a slight shake i didnt want to miss the party
its for us after all

i come up beside him and lean over the edge of the
rail the wide streets are full of dancing people i
squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail
are they in costumes
who could tell peeta answers with all the crazy
clothes they wear here couldnt sleep either
couldnt turn my mind off i say
thinking about your family he asks
no i admit a bit guiltily all i can do is wonder
about tomorrow which is pointless of course in the
light from below i can see his face now the awkward
way he holds his bandaged hands i really am sorry
about your hands
it doesnt matter katniss he says ive never been
a contender in these games anyway
thats no way to be thinking i say
why not its true my best hope is to not disgrace
myself and  he hesitates
and what i say
i dont know how to say it exactly only  i want to
die as myself does that make any sense he asks i
shake my head how could he die as anyone but
himself i dont want them to change me in there
turn me into some kind of monster that im not
i bite my lip feeling inferior while ive been
ruminating on the availability of trees peeta has been
struggling with how to maintain his identity his
purity of self do you mean you wont kill anyone i
ask

no when the time comes im sure ill kill just like
everybody else i cant go down without a fight only i
keep wishing i could think of a way to  to show the
capitol they dont own me that im more than just a
piece in their games says peeta
but youre not i say none of us are thats how
the games work
okay but within that framework theres still you
theres still me he insists dont you see
a little only  no offense but who cares peetai
say
i do i mean what else am i allowed to care about at
this point he asks angrily hes locked those blue
eyes on mine now demanding an answer
i take a step back care about what haymitch said
about staying alive
peeta smiles at me sad and mocking okay thanks
for the tip sweetheart
its like a slap in the face his use of haymitchs
patronizing endearment look if you want to spend
the last hours of your life planning some noble death
in the arena thats your choice i want to spend mine
in district twelve
wouldnt surprise me if you do says peeta give
my mother my best when you make it back will you
count on it i say then i turn and leave the roof i
spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a
doze imagining the cutting remarks i will make to
peeta mellark in the morning peeta mellark we will
see how high and mighty he is when hes faced with

life and death hell probably turn into one of those
raging beast tributes the kind who tries to eat
someones heart after theyve killed them there was a
guy like that a few years ago from district 6 called
titus he went completely savage and the
gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric
guns to collect the bodies of the players hed killed
before he ate them there are no rules in the arena
but cannibalism doesnt play well with the capitol
audience so they tried to head it off there was some
speculation that the avalanche that finally took titus
out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor
was not a lunatic
i dont see peeta in the morning cinna comes to me
before dawn gives me a simple shift to wear and
guides me to the roof my final dressing and
preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the
arena itself a hovercraft appears out of thin air just
like the one did in the woods the day i saw the
redheaded avox girl captured and a ladder drops
down i place my hands and feet on the lower rungs
and instantly its as if im frozen some sort of current
glues me to the ladder while im lifted safely inside
i expect the ladder to release me then but im still
stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me
carrying a syringe this is just your tracker katniss
the stiller you are the more efficiently i can place it
she says
still im a statue but that doesnt prevent me from
feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts
the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the
inside of my forearm now the gamemakers will
always be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena
wouldnt want to lose a tribute

as soon as the trackers in place the ladder releases
me the woman disappears and cinna is retrieved
from the roof an avox boy comes in and directs us to
a room where breakfast has been laid out despite the
tension in my stomachieat as much as i can
although none of the delectable food makes any
impression on me im so nervous i could be eating
coal dust the one thing that distracts me at all is the
view from the windows as we sail over the city and
then to the wilderness beyond this is what birds see
only theyre free and safe the very opposite of me
the ride lasts about half an hour before the windows
black out suggesting that were nearing the arena
the hovercraft lands and cinna and i go back to the
ladder only this time it leads down into a tube
underground into the catacombs that lie beneath the
arena we follow instructions to my destination a
chamber for my preparation in the capitol they call
it the launch room in the districts its referred to as
the stockyard the place animals go before slaughter
everything is brandnew i will be the first and only
tribute to use this launch room the arenas are
historic sites preserved after the games popular
destinations for capitol residents to visit to vacation
go for a month rewatch the games tour the
catacombs visit the sites where the deaths took
place you can even take part in reenactments they
say the food is excellent
i struggle to keep my breakfast down as i shower and
clean my teeth cinna does my hair in my simple
trademark braid down my back then the clothes
arrive the same for every tribute cinna has had no
say in my outfit does not even know what will be in
the package but he helps me dress in the
undergarments simple tawny pants light green
blouse sturdy brown belt and thin hooded black

jacket that falls to my thighs the material in the
jackets designed to reflect body heat expect some
cool nights he says
the boots worn over skintight socks are better than i
could have hoped for soft leather not unlike my ones
at home these have a narrow flexible rubber sole
with treads though good for running
i think im finished when cinna pulls the gold
mockingj ay pin from his pocket i had completely
forgotten about it
where did you get that i ask
off the green outfit you wore on the train he says i
remember now taking it off my mothers dress
pinning it to the shirt its your district token right
i nod and he fastens it on my shirt it barely cleared
the review board some thought the pin could be used
as a weapon giving you an unfair advantage but
eventually they let it through says cinna they
eliminated a ring from that district one girl though
if you twisted the gemstone a spike popped out
poisoned one she claimed she had no knowledge the
ring transformed and there was no way to prove she
did but she lost her token there youre all set move
around make sure everything feels comfortable
i walk run in a circle swing my arms about yes its
fine fits perfectly
then theres nothing to do but wait for the call says
cinna unless you think you could eat any more
i turn down food but accept a glass of water that i
take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch i dont want
to chew on my nails or lips so i find myself gnawing
on the inside of my cheek it still hasnt fully healed

from a few days ago soon the taste of blood fills my
mouth
nervousness seeps into terror as i anticipate what is
to come i could be dead flatout dead in an hour
not even my fingers obsessively trace the hard little
lump on my forearm where the woman injected the
tracking device i press on it even though it hurts i
press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form
do you want to talk katniss cinna asks
i shake my head but after a moment hold out my
hand to him cinna encloses it in both of his and
this is how we sit until a pleasant female voice
announces its time to prepare for launch
still clenching one of cinnas hands i walk over and
stand on the circular metal plate remember what
haymitch said run find water the rest will follow
he says i nod and remember this im not allowed to
bet but if i could my money would be on you
truly i whisper
truly says cinna he leans down and kisses me on
the forehead good luck girl on fire and then a
glass cylinder is lowering around me breaking our
handhold cutting him off from me he taps his
fingers under his chin head high
i lift my chin and stand as straight as i can the
cylinder begins to rise for maybe fifteen seconds im
in darkness and then i can feel the metal plate
pushing me out of the cylinder into the open air for
a moment my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight
and im conscious only of a strong wind with the
hopeful smell of pine trees

then i hear the legendary announcer claudius
templesmith as his voice booms all around me
ladies and gentlemen let the seventyfourth hunger
games begin

sixty seconds thats how long were required to stand
on our metal circles before the sound of a gong
releases us step off before the minute is up and land
mines blow your legs off sixty seconds to take in the
ring of tributes all equidistant from the cornucopia a
giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved
tail the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high
spilling over with the things that will give us life here
in the arena food containers of water weapons
medicine garments fire starters strewn around the
cornucopia are other supplies their value decreasing
the farther they are from the horn for instance only
a few steps from my feet lays a threefoot square of
plastic certainly it could be of some use in a
downpour but there in the mouth i can see a tent
pack that would protect from almost any sort of
weather if i had the guts to go in and fight for it
against the other twenty three tributes which i have
been instructed not to do
were on a flat open stretch of ground a plain of
hardpacked dirt behind the tributes across from me
i can see nothing indicating either a steep downward
slope or even cliff to my right lies a lake to my left
and back spars piney woods this is where haymitch
would want me to go immediately
i hear his instructions in my head just clear out
put as much distance as you can between yourselves
and the others and find a source of water
but its tempting so tempting when i see the bounty
waiting there before me and i know that if i dont get
it someone else will that the career tributes who

survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life
sustaining spoils something catches my eye there
resting on a mound of blanket rolls is a silver sheath
of arrows and a bow already strung just waiting to
be engaged thats mine i thinkits meant for me
im fast i can sprint faster than any of the girls in our
school although a couple can beat me in distance
races but this forty yard length this is what i am
built for i know i can get it i know i can reach it
first but then the question is how quickly can i get
out of there by the time ive scrambled up the packs
and grabbed the weapons others will have reached
the horn and one or two i might be able to pick off
but say theres a dozen at that close range they
could take me down with the spears and the clubs or
their own powerful fists
still i wont be the only target im betting many of
the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl even
one who scored an eleven in training to take out their
more fierce adversaries
haymitch has never seen me run maybe if he had
hed tell me to go for it get the weapon since thats
the very weapon that might be my salvation and i
only see one bow in that whole pile i know the
minute must be almost up and will have to decide
what my strategy will be and i find myself positioning
my feet to run not away into the stir rounding forests
but toward the pile toward the bow when suddenly i
notice peeta hes about five tributes to my right quite
a fair distance still i can tell hes looking at me and i
think he might be shaking his head but the suns in
my eyes and while im puzzling over it the gong rings
out
and ive missed it ive missed my chance because
those extra couple of seconds ive lost by not being

ready are enough to change my mind about going in
my feet shuffle for a moment confused at the
direction my brain wants to take and then i lunge
forward scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of
bread the pickings are so small and im so angry
with peeta for distracting me that i sprint in twenty
yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could
hold anything because i cant stand leaving with
virtually nothing
a boy i think from district 9 reaches the pack at the
same time i do and for a brief time we grapple for it
and then he coughs splattering my face with blood i
stagger back repulsed by the warm sticky spray
then the boy slips to the ground thats when i see
the knife in his back already other tributes have
reached the cornucopia and are spreading out to
attack yes the girl from district 2 ten yards away
running toward me one hand clutching a halfdozen
knives ive seen her throw in training she never
misses and im her next target
all the general fear ive been feeling condenses into at
immediate fear of this girl this predator who might
kill me in seconds adrenaline shoots through me and
i sling the pack over one shoulder and run full speed
for the woods i can hear the blade whistling toward
me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my
head the blade lodges in the pack both straps on
my shoulders now i make for the trees somehow i
know the girl will not pursue me that shell be drawn
back into the cornucopia before all the good stuff is
gone a grin crosses my face thanks for the knife i
think
at the edge of the woods i turn for one instant to
survey the field about a dozen or so tributes are
hacking away at one another at the horn several lie
dead already on the ground those who have taken

flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void
opposite me i continue running until the woods have
hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a
steady jog that i think i can maintain for a while for
the next few hours i alternate between jogging and
walking putting as much distance as i can between
myself and my competitors i lost my bread during
the struggle with the boy from district 9 but managed
to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as i walk i fold it
neatly and tuck it into a pocket i also free the knife
— its a fine one with a long sharp blade serrated
near the handle which will make it handy for sawing
through things — and slide it into my belt i dont
dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet i
just keep moving pausing only to check for pursuers
i can go a long time i know that from my days in the
woods but i will need water that was haymitchs
second instruction and since i sort of botched the
first i keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it no luck
the woods begin to evolve and the pines are
intermixed with a variety of trees some i recognize
some completely foreign to me at one point i hear a
noise and pull my knife thinking i may have to
defend myself but ive only startled a rabbit good to
see you i whisper if theres one rabbit there could
be hundreds just waiting to be snared
the ground slopes down i dont particularly like this
valleys make me feel trapped i want to be high like
in the hills around district 12 where i can see my
enemies approaching but i have no choice but to
keep going
funny though i dont feel too bad the days of
gorging myself have paid off ive got staying power
even though im short on sleep being in the woods is
rejuvenating im glad for the solitude even though

its an illusion because im probably onscreen right
now not consistently but off and on there are so
many deaths to show the first day that a tribute
trekking through the woods isnt much to look at but
they 11 show me enough to let people know im alive
uninjured and on the move one of the heaviest days
of betting is the opening when the initial casualties
come in but that cant compare to what happens as
the field shrinks to a handful of players
its late afternoon when i begin to hear the cannons
each shot represents a dead tribute the fighting
must have finally stopped at the cornucopia they
never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers
have dispersed on the opening day they dont even
fire the cannons until the initial fightings over
because its too hard to keep track of the fatalities i
allow myself to pause panting as i count the shots
one    two    three  on and on until they reach
eleven eleven dead in all thirteen left to play my
fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from
district 9 coughed into my face hes gone certainly i
wonder about peeta has he lasted through the day
ill know in a few hours when they project the deads
images into the sky for the rest of us to see
all of a sudden im overwhelmed by the thought that
peeta may be already lost bled white collected and
in the process of being transported back to the
capitol to be cleaned up redressed and shipped in a
simple wooden box back to district 12 no longer
here heading home i try hard to remember if i saw
him once the action started but the last image i can
conjure up is peeta shaking his head as the gong rang
out
maybe its better if hes gone already he had no
confidence he could win and i will not end up with

the unpleasant task of killing him maybe its better if
hes out of this for good
i slump down next to my pack exhausted i need to
go through it anyway before night falls see what i
have to work with as i unhook the straps i can feel
its sturdily made although a rather unfortunate
color this orange will practically glow in the dark i
make a mental note to camouflage it first thing
tomorrow
i flip open the flap what i want most right at this
moment is water haymitchs directive to immediately
find water was not arbitrary i wont last long without
it for a few days 111 be able to function with
unpleasant symptomsof dehydration but after that
ill deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a
week tops i carefully lay out the provisions one thin
black sleeping bag that reflects body heal a pack of
crackers a pack of dried beef strips a bottle of
iodine a box of wooden matches a small coil of wire
a pair of sunglasses and a halfgallon plastic bottle
with a cap for carrying water thats bone dry
no water how hard would it have been for them to fill
up the bottle i become aware of the dryness in my
throat and mouth the cracks in my lips ive been
moving all day long its been hot and ive sweat a lot
i do this at home but there are always streams to
drink from or snow to melt if it should come to it
as i refill my pack i have an awful thought the lake
the one i saw while i was waiting for the gong to
sound what if thats the only water source in the
arena that way theyll guarantee drawing us in to
fight the lake is a full days journey from where i sit
now a much harder journey with nothing to drink
and then even if i reach it its sure to be heavily
guarded by some of the career tributes im about to

panic when i remember the rabbit i startled earlier
today it has to drink too i just have to find out
where
twilight is closing in and i am ill at ease the trees
are too thin to offer much concealment the layer of
pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes
tracking animals harder when i need their trails to
find water and im still heading downhill deeper and
deeper into a valley that seems endless
im hungry too but i dont dare break into my
precious store of crackers and beef yet instead i take
my knife and go to work on a pine tree cutting away
the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the
softer inner bark i slowly chew the stuff as i walk
along after a week of the finest food in the world its
a little hard to choke down but ive eaten plenty of
pine in my life ill adjust quickly
in another hour its clear ive got to find a place to
camp night creatures are coming out i can hear the
occasional hoot or howl my first clue that 111 be
competing with natural predators for the rabbits as
to whether 111 be viewed as a source of food its too
soon to tell there could be any number of animals
stalking me at this moment
but right now i decide to make my fellow tributes a
priority im sure many will continue hunting through
the night those who fought it out at the cornucopia
will have food an abundance of water from the lake
torches or flashlights and weapons theyre itching to
use i can only hope ive traveled far and fast enough
to be out of range
before settling down i take my wire and set two
twitchup snares in the brush i know its risky to be
setting traps but food will go so fast out here and i

cant set snares on the run still i walk another five
minutes before making camp
i pick my tree carefully a willow not terribly tall but
set in a clump of other willows offering concealment
in those long flowing tresses i climb up sticking to
the stronger branches close to the trunk and find a
sturdy fork for my bed it takes some doing but i
arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable
manner i place my backpack in the foot of the bag
then slide in after it as a precaution i remove my
belt loop it all the way around the branch and my
sleeping bag and refasten it at my waist now if i roll
over in my sleep i wont go crashing to the ground
im small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my
head but i put on my hood as well as night falls the
air is cooling quickly despite the risk i took in getting
the backpack i know now it was the right choice
this sleeping bag radiating back and preserving my
body heat will be invaluable im sure there are
several other tributes whose biggest concern right
now is how to stay warm whereas i may actually be
able to get a few hours of sleep if only i wasnt so
thirsty
night has just come when i hear the anthem that
proceeds the death recap through the branches i can
see the seal of the capitol which appears to be
floating in the sky im actually viewing another
screen an enormous one thats transported by of one
of their disappearing hovercraft the anthem fades
out and the sky goes dark for a moment at home we
would be watching full coverage of each and every
killing but thats thought to give an unfair advantage
to the living tributes for instance if i got my hands
on the bow and shot someone my secret would be
revealed to all no here in the arena all we see are
the same photographs they showed when they
televised our training scores simple head shots but

now instead of scores they post only district numbers
i take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead
tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my
fingers
the first to appear is the girl from district 3 that
means that the career tributes from 1 and 2 have all
survived no surprise there then the boy from 4 i
didnt expect that one usually all the careers make it
through the first day the boy from district 5  i
guess the foxfaced girl made it both tributes from 6
and 7 the boy from 8 both from 9 yes theres the
boy who i fought for the backpack ive run through
my fingers only one more dead tribute to go is it
peeta no theres the girl from district 10 thats it
the capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish
then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume
im relieved peetas alive i tell myself again that if i
get killed his winning will benefit my mother and
prim the most this is what i tell myself to explain the
conflicting emotions that arise when i think of peeta
the gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing
his love for me in the interview the anger at his
superiority on the roof the dread that we may come
facetoface at any moment in this arena
eleven dead but none from district 12 i try to work
out who is left five career tributes foxface thresh
and rue rue  so she made it through the first day
after all i cant help feeling glad that makes ten of
us the other three ill figure out tomorrow now when
it is dark and i have traveled far and i am nestled
high in this tree now i must try and rest
i havent really slept in two days and then theres
been the long days journey into the arena slowly i
allow my muscles to relax my eyes to close the last
thing i think is its lucky i dont snore

snap the sound of a breaking branch wakes me
how long have i been asleep four hours five the
tip of my nose is icy cold snap snap whats going
on this is not the sound of a branch under
someones foot but the sharp crack of one coming
from a tree snap snap i judge it to be several
hundred yards to my right slowly noiselessly i turn
myself in that direction for a few minutes theres
nothing but blackness and some scuffling then i see
a spark and a small fire begins to bloom a pair of
hands warms over flames but i cant make out more
than that
i have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name i
know at the fire starter what are they thinking a
fire 111 just at nightfall would have been one thing
those who battled at the cornucopia with their
superior strength and surplus of supplies they
couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the
flames then but now when theyve probably been
combing the woods for hours looking for victims you
might as well be waving a flag and shouting come
and get me
and here i am a stones throw from the biggest idiot
in the games strapped in a tree not daring to flee
since my general location has just been broadcast to
any killer who cares i mean i know its cold out here
and not everybody has a sleeping bag but then you
grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn
i lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of
hours really thinking that if i can get out of this tree i
wont have the least problem taking out my new
neighbor my instinct has been to flee not fight but
obviously this persons a hazard stupid people are
dangerous and this one probably doesnt have much
in the way of weapons while ive got this excellent
knife

the sky is still dark but i can feel the first signs of
dawn approaching im beginning to think we —
meaning the person whose death im now devising
and me — we might actually have gone unnoticed
then i hear it several pairs of feet breaking into a
run the fire starter must have dozed off theyre on
her before she can escape i know its a girl now i can
tell by the pleading the agonized scream that follows
then theres laughter and congratulations from
several voices someone cries out twelve down and
eleven to go which gets a round of appreciative
hoots
so theyre fighting in a pack im not really surprised
often alliances are formed in the early stages of the
games the strong band together to hunt down the
weak then when the tension becomes too great begin
to turn on one another i dont have to wonder too
hard who has made this alliance it 11 be the
remaining career tributes from districts 12 and 4
two boys and three girls the ones who lunched
together
for a moment i hear them checking the girl for
supplies i can tell by their comments theyve found
nothing good i wonder if the victim is rue but
quickly dismiss the thought shes much too bright to
be building a fire like that
better clear out so they can get the body before it
starts stinking im almost certain thats the brutish
boy from district 2 there are murmurs of assent and
then to my horror i hear the pack heading toward
me they do not know im here how could they and
im well concealed in the clump of trees at least while
the sun stays down then my black sleeping bag will
turn from camouflage to trouble if they just keep
moving they will pass me and be gone in a minute

but the careers stop in the clearing about ten yards
from my tree they have flashlights torches i can see
an arm here a boot there through the breaks in the
branches i turn to stone not even daring to breathe
have they spotted me no not yet i can tell from
their words their minds are elsewhere
shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now
id say yes nothing to prevent them from going in
immediately
unless she isnt dead
shes dead i stuck her myself
then where s the cannon
someone should go back make sure the jobs done
yeah we dont want to have to track her down
twice
i said shes dead
an argument breaks out until one tribute silences the
others were wasting time ill go finish her and lets
move on
i almost fall out of the tree the voice belongs to
peeta

thank goodness i had the foresight to belt myself in
ive rolled sideways off the fork and im facing the
ground held in place by the belt one hand and my
feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag
braced against the trunk there must have been some
rustling when i tipped sideways but the careers have
been too caught up in their own argument to catch it
go on then lover boy says the boy from district
2 see for yourself
i just get a glimpse of peeta lit by a torch heading
back to the girl by the fire his face is swollen with
bruises theres a bloody bandage on one arm and
from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat i
remember him shaking him his head telling me not
to go into the fight for the supplies when all along all
along hed planned to throw himself into the thick of
things just the opposite of what haymitch had mid
him to do
okay i can stomach that seeing all those supplies
was tempting but this    this other thing this
teaming up with the career wolf pack to hunt down
the rest of us no one from district 12 would think of
doing such a thing career tributes are overly vicious
arrogant better fed but only because theyre the
capitols lapdogs
universally solidly hated by all but those from their
own districts i can imagine the things theyre saying
about him back home now and peeta had the gall to
talk to me about disgrace

obviously the noble boy on the rooftop was playing
just one more game with me but this will be his last
i will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his
death if i dont kill him first myself
the career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear
shot then use hushed voices
why dont we just kill him now and get it over with
let him tag along whats the harm and hes handy
with that knife
is he thats news what a lot of interesting things
im learning about my friend peeta today
besides hes our best chance of finding her
it takes me a moment to register that the her theyre
referring to is me
why you think she bought into that sappy romance
stuff
she might have seemed pretty simpleminded to me
every time i think about her spinning around in that
dress i want to puke
wish we knew how she got that eleven
bet you lover boy knows
the sound of peeta returning silences them
was she dead asks the boy from district 2
no but she is now says peeta just then the
cannon fires ready to move on

the career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins
to break and birdsong fills the air i remain in my
awkward position muscles trembling with exertion
for a while longer then hoist myself back onto my
branch i need to get down to get going but for a
moment i lie there digesting what ive heard not only
is peeta with the careers hes helping them find me
the simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously
because of her eleven because she can use a bow
and arrow which peeta knows better than anyone
but he hasnt told them yet is he saving that
information because he knows its all that keeps him
alive is he still pretending to love me for the
audience what is going on in his head
suddenly the birds fall silent then one gives a high
pitched warning call a single note just like the one
gale and i heard when the redheaded avox girl was
caught high above the dying campfire a hovercraft
materializes a set of huge metal teeth drops down
slowly gently the dead tribute girl is lifted into the
hovercraft then it vanishes the birds resume their
song
move i whisper to myself i wriggle out of my
sleeping bag roll it up and place it in the pack i take
a deep breath while ive been concealed by darkness
and the sleeping bag and the willow branches it has
probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good
shot of me i know they must be tracking me now
though the minute i hit the ground im guaranteed
a closeup
the audience will have been beside themselves
knowing i was in the tree that i overheard the
careers talking that i discovered peeta was with
them until i work out exactly how i want to play that

id better at least act on top of things not perplexed
certainly not confused or frightened
no i need to look one step ahead of the game
so as i slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light
i pause a second giving the cameras time to lock on
me then i cock my head slightly to the side and give
a knowing smile there let them figure out what that
means
im about to take off when i think of my snares
maybe its imprudent to check them with the others
so close but have to too many years of hunting i
guess and the lure of possible meat im rewarded
with one fine rabbit in no time ive cleaned and
gutted the animal leaving the head feet tail skin
and innards under a pile of leaves im wishing for a
fire — eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever a
lesson i learned the hard way — when i think of the
dead tribute i hurry back to her camp sure enough
the coals of her dying fire are still hot i cut up the
rabbit fashion a spit out of branches and set it over
the coals
im glad for the cameras now i want sponsors to see i
can hunt that im a good bet because i wont be lured
into traps as easily as the others will by hunger
while the rabbit cooks i grind up part of a charred
branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack
the black tones it down but i feel a layer of mud
would definitely help of course to have mud id
need water
i pull on my gear grab my spit kick some dirt over
the coals and take off in the opposite direction the
careers went i eat half the rabbit as i go then wrap
up the leftovers in my plastic for later the meat stops

the grumbling in my stomach but does little to
quench my thirst water is my top priority now
as i hike along i feel certain im still holding the
screen in the capitol so im careful to continue to
hide my emotions but what a good time claudius
templesmith must be having with his guest
commentators dissecting peetas behavior my
reaction what to make of it all has peeta revealed
his true colors how does this affect the betting odds
will we lose sponsors do we even have sponsors
yes i feel certain we do or at least did
certainly peeta has thrown a wrench into our star
crossed lover dynamic or has he maybe since he
hasnt spoken much about me we can still get some
mileage out of it maybe people will think its
something we plotted together if i seem like it amuses
me now
the sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy
it seems overly bright i coat my lips in some grease
from the rabbit and try to keep from panting but its
no use its only been a day and im dehydrating fast
i try and think of everything i know about finding
water it runs downhill so in fact continuing down
into this valley isnt a bad thing if i could just locate
a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of
vegetation these might help me along but nothing
seems to change theres just the slight gradual slope
the birds the sameness to the trees
as the day wears on i know im headed for trouble
what little urine ive been able to pass is a dark
brown my head is aching and theres a dry patch on
my tongue that refuses to moisten the sun hurts my
eyes so i dig out my sunglasses but when i put them
on they do something funny to my vision so i just
stuff them back in my pack

its late afternoon when i think ive found help i spot
a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit
to suck the sweet juices from the skins but just as
im holding them to my lips i get a hard look at them
what i thought were blueberries have a slightly
different shape and when i break one open the
insides are bloodred i dont recognize these berries
perhaps they are edible but im guessing this is some
evil trick on the part of the gamemakers even the
plant instructor in the training center made a point
of telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100
percent sure they werent toxic something i already
knew but im so thirsty it takes her reminder to give
me the strength to fling them away
fatigue is beginning to settle on me but its not the
usual tiredness that follows a long hike i have to stop
and rest frequently although i know the only cure for
what ails me requires continued searching i try a
new tactic — climbing a tree as high as i dare in my
shaky state — to look for any signs of water but as
far as i can see in any direction theres the same
unrelenting stretch of forest
determined to go on until nightfall i walk until im
stumbling over my own feet
exhausted i haul myself up into a tree and belt
myself in ive no appetite but i suck on a rabbit bone
just to give my mouth something to do night falls
the anthem plays and high in the sky i see the
picture of the girl who was apparently from district
8 the one peeta went back to finish off
my fear of the career pack is minor compared to my
burning thirst besides they were heading away from
me and by now they too will have to rest with the
scarcity of water they may even have had to return to
the lake for refills

maybe that is the only course for me as well
morning brings distress my heads throbs with every
beat of my heart simple movements send stabs of
pain through my joints i fall rather than jump from
the tree it takes several minutes for me to assemble
my gear somewhere inside me i know this is wrong
i should be acting with more caution moving with
more urgency but my mind seems foggy and forming
a plan is hard i lean back against the trunk of my
tree one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper
surface of my tongue as i assess my options how
can i get water
return to the lake no good id never make it
hope for rain theres not a cloud in the sky
keep looking yes this is my only chance but then
another thought hits me and the surge of anger that
follows brings me to me senses
haymitch he could send me water press a button
and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in
minutes i know i must have sponsors at least one or
two who could afford a pint of liquid for me yes its
pricey but these people theyre made of money and
theyll be betting on me as well perhaps haymitch
doesnt realize how deep my need is
i say in a voice as loud as i dare water i wait
hopefully for a parachute to descend from the sky
but nothing is forthcoming
something is wrong am i deluded about having
sponsors or has peetas behavior made them all
hang back no i dont believe it theres someone out
there who wants to buy me water only haymitch is
refusing to let it go through as my mentor he gets to

control the flow of gifts from the sponsors i know he
hates me hes made that clear enough but enough
to let me die from this he cant do that can he if
a mentor mistreats his tributes hell be held
accountable by the viewers by the people back in
district 12 even haymitch wouldnt risk that would
he say what you will about my fellow traders in the
hob but i dont think theyd welcome him back there
if he let me die this way and then where would he get
his liquor so    what is he trying to make me suffer
for defying him is he directing all the sponsors
toward peeta is he just too drunk to even notice
whats going on at the moment somehow i dont
believe that and i dont believe hes trying to kill me
off by neglect either he has in fact in his own
unpleasant way genuinely been trying to prepare me
for this then what is going on
i bury my face in my hands theres no danger of
tears now i couldnt produce one to save my life
what is haymitch doing despite my anger hatred
and suspicions a small voice in the back of my head
whispers an answer
maybe hes sending you a message it says a
message saying what then i know theres only one
good reason haymitch could be withholding water
from me because he knows ive almost found it
i grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet my
backpack seems to have tripled in weight i find a
broken branch that will do for a walking stick and i
start off the suns beating down even more searing
than the first two days i feel like an old piece of
leather drying and cracking in the heat every step is
an effort but i refuse to stop i refuse to sit down if i
sit theres a good chance i wont be able to get up
again that i wont even remember my task

what easy prey i am any tribute even tiny rue
could take me right now merely shove me over and
kill me with my own knife and id have little strength
to resist but if anyone is in my part of the woods
they ignore me the truth is i feel a million miles
from another living soul
not alone though no theyve surely got a camera
tracking me now i think back to the years of
watching tributes starve freeze bleed and dehydrate
to death unless theres a really good fight going on
somewhere im being featured
my thoughts turn to prim its likely she wont be
watching me live but theyll show updates at the
school during lunch for her sake i try to look as
least desperate as i can
but by afternoon i know the end is coming my legs
are shaking and my heart too quick i keep forgetting
exactly what im doing ive stumbled repeatedly and
managed to regain my feet but when the stick slides
out from under me i finally tumble to the ground
unable to get up i let my eyes close
i have misjudged haymitch he has no intention of
helping me at all
this is all right i think this is not so bad here the
air is less hot signifying evenings approach theres
a slight sweet scent that reminds me of lilies my
fingers stroke the smooth ground sliding easily
across the top this is an okay place to die i think
my fingertips make small swirling patterns in the
cool slippery earth ilove mud i think how many
times ive tracked game with the help of its soft
readable surface good for bee stings too mud mud
mud my eyes fly open and i dig my fingers into the

earth it is mud my nose lifts in the air and those
are lilies pond lilies
i crawl now through the mud dragging myself
toward the scent five yards from where i fell i crawl
through a tangle of plants into a pond floating on
the top yellow flowers in bloom are my beautiful
lilies
its all i can do not to plunge my face into the water
and gulp down as much as i can hold but i have jus
enough sense left to abstain with trembling hands i
get out my flask and fill it with water i add what i
remember to be the right number of drops of iodine
for purifying it the half an hour of waiting is agony
but i do it at least
i think its a half an hour but its certainly as long as
i can stand
slowly easy now i tell myself i take one swallow and
make myself wait then another over the next couple
of hours i drink the entire half gallon then a second
i prepare another before i retire to a tree where i
continue sipping eating rabbit and even indulge in
one of my precious crackers by the time the anthem
plays i feel remarkably better there are no faces
tonight no tributes died today tomorrow 111 stay
here resting camouflaging my backpack with mud
catching some of those little fish i saw as i sipped
digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice
meal i snuggle down in my sleeping bag hanging on
to my water bottle for dear life which of course it is
a few hours later the stampede of feet shakes me
from slumber i look around in bewilderment its not
yet dawn but my stinging eyes can see it

it would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on
me

my first impulse is to scramble from the tree but im
belted in somehow my fumbling fingers release the
buckle and i fall to the ground in a heap still snarled
in my sleeping bag theres no time for any kind of
packing fortunately my backpack and water bottle
are already in the bag i shove in the belt hoist the
bag over my shoulder and flee
the world has transformed to flame and smoke
burning branches crack from trees and fall in
showers of sparks at my feet all i can do is follow the
others the rabbits and deer and i even spot a wild
dog pack shooting through the woods i trust their
sense of direction because their instincts are sharper
than mine but they are much faster flying through
the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on
roots and fallen tree limbs that theres no way i can
keep apace with them
the heat is horrible but worse than the heat is the
smoke which threatens to suffocate me at any
moment i pull the top of my shirt up over my nose
grateful to find it soaked in sweat and it offers a thin
veil of protection and i run choking my bag banging
against my back my face cut with branches that
materialize from the gray haze without warning
because i know i am supposed to run
this was no tributes campfire gone out of control no
accidental occurrence the flames that bear down on
me have an unnatural height a uniformity that
marks them as humanmade machinemade
gamemakermade things have been too quiet today
no deaths perhaps no fights at all the audience in
the capitol will be getting bored claiming that these

games are verging on dullness this is the one thing
the games must not do
its not hard to follow the gamemakers motivation
there is the career pack and then there are the rest
of us probably spread far and thin across the arena
this fire is designed to flush us out to drive us
together it may not be the most original device ive
seen but its very very effective
i hurdle over a burning log not high enough the tail
end of my jacket catches on fire and i have to stop to
rip it from my body and stamp out the flames but i
dont dare leave the jacket scorched and smoldering
as it is i take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping
bag hoping the lack of air will quell what i havent
extinguished this is all i have what i carry on my
back and its little enough to survive with
in a matter of minutes my throat and nose are
burning the coughing begins soon after and my
lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being
cooked discomfort turns to distress until each breath
sends a searing pain through my chest i manage to
take cover under a stone outcropping just as the
vomiting begins and i lose my meager supper and
whatever water has remained in my stomach
crouching on my hands and knees i retch until
theres nothing left to come up
i know i need to keep moving but im trembling and
lightheaded now gasping for air i allow myself about
a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then
take a few swallows from my bottle you get one
minute i tell myself one minute to rest i take the
time to reorder my supplies wad up the sleeping bag
and messily stuff everything into the backpack my
minutes up i know its time to move on but the
smoke has clouded my thoughts the swiftfooted

animals that were my compass have left me behind i
know i havent been in this part of the woods before
there were no sizable rocks like the one im sheltering
against on my earlier travels where are the
gamemakers driving me back to the lake to a
whole new terrain filled with new dangers i had just
found a few hours of peace at the pond when this
attack began would there be any way i could travel
parallel to the fire and work my way back there to a
source of water at least the wall of fire must have an
end and it wont burn indefinitely not because the
gamemakers couldnt keep it fueled but because
again that would invite accusations of boredom from
the audience if i could get back behind the fire line i
could avoid meeting up with the careers ive just
decided to try and loop back around although it will
require miles of travel away from the inferno and then
a very circuitous route back when the first fireball
blasts into the rock about two feet from my head i
spring out from under my ledge energized by renewed
fear
the game has taken a twist the fire was just to get
us moving now the audience will get to see some real
fun when i hear the next hiss i flatten on the
ground not taking time to look the fireball hits a
tree off to my left engulfing it in flames to remain
still is death im barely on my feet before the third
ball hits the ground where i was lying sending a
pillar of fire up behind me time loses meaning now
as i frantically try to dodge the attacks i cant see
where theyre being launched from but its not a
hovercraft the angles are not extreme enough
probably this whole segment of the woods has been
armed with precision launchers that are concealed in
trees or rocks somewhere in a cool and spotless
room a gamemaker sits at a set of controls fingers
on the triggers that could end my life in a second all
that is needed is a direct hit

whatever vague plan i had conceived regarding
returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as i
zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs each
one is only the size of an apple but packs
tremendous power on contact every sense i have
goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over
theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one
when theres a hiss i act or die
something keeps me moving forward though a
lifetime of watching the hunger games lets me know
that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain
attacks and that if i can just get away from this
section i might be able to move out of reach of the
launchers i might also then fall straight into a pit of
vipers but i cant worry about that now
how long i scramble along dodging the fireballs i cant
say but the attacks finally begin to abate which is
good because im retching again this time its an
acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its
way into my nose as well im forced to stop as my
body convulses trying desperately to rid itself of the
poisons ive been sucking in during the attack i wait
for the next hiss the next signal to bolt it doesnt
come the force of the retching has squeezed tears
out of my stinging eyes my clothes are drenched in
sweat somehow through the smoke and vomit i
pick up the scent of singed hair my hand fumbles to
my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least
six inches of it strands of blackened hair crumble in
my fingers i stare at them fascinated by the
transformation when the hissing registers
my muscles react only not fast enough this time the
fireball crashes into the ground at my side but not
before it skids across my right calf seeing my pants
leg on fire sends me over the edge i twist and scuttle
backward on my hands and feet shrieking trying to

remove myself from the horror when i finally regain
enough sense i roll the leg back and forth on the
ground which stifles the worst of it but then
without thinking i rip away the remaining fabric with
my bare hands
i sit on the ground a few yards from the blaze set off
by the fireball my calf is screaming my hands
covered in red welts im shaking too hard to move if
the gamemakers want to finish me off now is the
time
i hear cinnas voice carrying images of rich fabric
and sparkling gems katniss the girl who was on
fire what a good laugh the gamemakers must be
having over that one perhaps cinnas beautiful
costumes have even brought on this particular
torture for me i know he couldnt have foreseen this
must be hurting for me because in fact i believe he
cares about me but all in all maybe showing up
stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for
me
the attack is now over the gamemakers dont want
me dead not yet anyway everyone knows they could
destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong the
real sport of the hunger games is watching the
tributes kill one another every so often they do kill a
tribute just to remind the players they can but
mostly they manipulate us into confronting one
another facetoface which means if i am no longer
being fired at there is at least one other tribute close
at hand
i would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if i
could but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me i
make myself stand and begin to limp away from the
wall of flames that lights up the sky it does not seem

to be pursuing me any longer except with its stinking
black clouds
another light daylight begins to softly emerge swirls
of smoke catch the sunbeams my visibility is poor i
can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction a tribute
could easily be concealed from me here i should draw
my knife as a precaution but i doubt my ability to
hold it for long the pain in my hands can in no way
compete with that in my calf i hate burns have
always hated them even a small one gotten from
pulling a pan of bread from the oven it is the worst
kind of pain to me but i have never experienced
anything like this
im so weary i dont even notice im in the pool until
im ankledeep its springfed bubbling up out of a
crevice in some rocks and blissfully cool i plunge my
hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief
isnt that what my mother always says the first
treatment for a burn is cold water that it draws out
the heat but she means minor burns probably shed
recommend it for my hands but what of my calf
although i have not yet had the courage to examine
it im guessing that its an injury in a whole different
class
i lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while
dangling my hands in the water examining the little
flames on my fingernails that are beginning to chip
off good ive had enough fire for a lifetime
i bathe the blood and ash from my face i try to recall
all i know about burns they are common injuries in
the seam where we cook and heat our homes with
coal then there are the mine accidents  a family
once brought in an unconscious young man pleading
with my mother to help him the district doctor whos
responsible for treating the miners had written him

off told the family to take him home to die but they
wouldnt accept this he lay on our kitchen table
senseless to the world i got a glimpse of the wound
on his thigh gaping charred flesh burned clear
down to the bone before i ran from the house i went
to the woods and hunted the entire day haunted by
the gruesome leg memories of my fathers death
whats funny was prim whos scared of her own
shadow stayed and helped my mother says healers
are born not made they did their best but the man
died just like the doctor said he would
my leg is in need of attention but i still cant look at
it what if its as bad as the mans and i can see my
bone then i remember my mother saying that if a
burns severe the victim might not even feel pain
because the nerves would be destroyed encouraged
by this i sit up and swing my leg in front of me
i almost faint at the sight of my calf the flesh is a
brilliant red covered with blisters i force myself to
take deep slow breaths feeling quite certain the
cameras are on my face i cant show weakness at this
injury not if i want help pity does not get you aid
admiration at your refusal to give in does i cut the
remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine
the injury more closely the burned area is about the
size of my hand none of the skin is blackened i
think its not too bad to soak gingerly i stretch out
my leg into the pool propping the heel of my boot on
a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden and sigh
because this does offer some relief i know there are
herbs if i could find them that would speed the
healing but i cant quite call them to mind water
and time will probably be all i have to work with
should i be moving on the smoke is slowly clearing
but still too heavy to be healthy if i do continue away
from the fire wont i be walking straight into the

weapons of the careers besides every time i lift my
leg from the water the pain rebounds so intensely i
have to slide it back in my hands are slightly less
demanding they can handle small breaks from the
pool so i slowly put my gear back in order first i fill
my bottle with the pool water treat it and when
enough time has passed begin to rehydrate my body
after a time i force myself to nibble on a cracker
which helps settle my stomach i roll up my sleeping
bag except for a few black marks its relatively
unscathed my jackets another matter stinking and
scorched at least a foot of the back beyond repair i
cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment
that comes just to the bottom of my ribs but the
hoods intact and its far better than nothing
despite the pain drowsiness begins to take over id
take to a tree and try to rest except id be too easy to
spot besides abandoning my pool seems impossible
i neatly arrange my supplies even settle my pack on
my shoulders but i cant seem to leave i spot some
water plants with edible roots and make a small meal
with my last piece of rabbit sip water watch the sun
make its slow arc across the sky where would i go
anyway that is any safer than here i lean back on
my pack overcome by drowsiness if the careers
want me let them find me i think before drifting into
a stupor let them find me
and find me they do its lucky im ready to move on
because when i hear the feet i have less than a
minute head start evening has begun to fall the
moment i awake im up and running splashing
across the pool flying into the underbrush my leg
slows me down but i sense my pursuers are not as
speedy as they were before the fire either i hear their
coughs their raspy voices calling to one another

still they are closing in just like a pack of wild dogs
and so i do what i have done my whole life in such
circumstances i pick a high tree and begin to climb
if running hurt climbing is agonizing because it
requires not only exertion but direct contact of my
hands on the tree bark im fast though and by the
time theyve reached the base of my trunk im twenty
feet up for a moment we stop and survey one
another i hope they cant hear the pounding of my
heart
this could be it i think what chance do i have
against them all six are there the five careers and
peeta and my only consolation is theyre pretty beat
up too even so look at their weapons look at their
faces grinning and snarling at me a sure kill above
them it seems pretty hopeless but then something
else registers theyre bigger and stronger than i am
no doubt but theyre also heavier theres a reason
its me and not gale who ventures up to pluck the
highest fruit or rob the most remote bird nests i
must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the
smallest career
now i smile hows everything with you i call down
cheerfully
this takes them aback but i know the crowd will love
it
well enough says the boy from district
2 yourself
its been a bit warm for my taste i say i can almost
hear the laughter from the capitol the airs better
up here why dont you come on up
think i will says the same boy

here take this cato says the girl from district 1
and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of
arrows my bow my arrows just the sight of them
makes me so angry i want to scream at myself at
that traitor peeta for distracting me from having
them i try to make eye contact with him now but he
seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he
polishes his knife with the edge of his shirt
no says cato pushing away the bow ill do better
with my sword i can see the weapon a short heavy
blade at his belt
i give cato time to hoist himself into the tree before i
begin to climb again gale always says i remind him
of a squirrel the way i can scurry up even the
slenderest limb part of its my weight but part of its
practice you have to know where to place your hands
and feet im another thirty feet in the air when i hear
the crack and look down to see cato flailing as he and
a branch go down he hits the ground hard and im
hoping he possibly broke his neck when he gets back
to his feet swearing like a fiend
the girl with the arrows glimmer i hear someone call
her — ugh the names the people in district 1 give
their children are so ridiculous — anyway glimmer
scales the tree until the branches begin to crack
under her feet and then has the good sense to stop
im at least eighty feet high now she tries to shoot me
and its immediately evident that shes incompetent
with a bow one of the arrows gets lodged in the tree
near me though and im able to seize it i wave it
teasingly above her head as if this was the sole
purpose of retrieving it when actually i mean to use it
if i ever get the chance i could kill them everyone of
them if those silver weapons were in my hands

the careers regroup on the ground and i can hear
them growling conspiratorially among themselves
furious i have made them look foolish but twilight
has arrived and their window of attack on me is
closing finally i hear peeta say harshly oh let her
stay up there its not like shes going anywhere well
deal with her in the morning
well hes right about one thing im going nowhere
all the relief from the pool water has gone leaving me
to feel the full potency of my burns i scoot down to a
fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed put on
my jacket lay out my sleeping bed belt myself in
and try to keep from moaning the heat of the bags
too much for my leg i cut a slash in the fabric and
hang my calf out in the open air i drizzle water on
the wound my hands
all my bravado is gone im weak from pain and
hunger but cant bring myself to eat even if i can last
the night what will the morning bring i stare into
the foliage trying to will myself to rest but the burns
forbid it birds are settling down for the night singing
lullabies to their young night creatures emerge an
owl hoots the faint scent of a skunk cuts through
the smoke the eyes of some animal peer at me from
the neighboring tree — a possum maybe — catching
the firelight from the careers torches suddenly im
up on one elbow those are no possums eyes i know
their glassy reflection too well in fact those are not
animal eyes at all in the last dim rays of light i make
her out watching me silently from between the
branches rue
how long has she been here the whole time
probably still and unobserved as the action unfolded
beneath her perhaps she headed up her tree shortly
before i did hearing the pack was so close

for a while we hold each others gaze then without
even rustling a leaf her little hand slides into the
open and points to something above my head

my eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage
above me at first i have no idea what shes pointing
to but then about fifteen feet up i make out the
vague shape in the dimming light but of  of what
some sort of animal it looks about the size of a
raccoon but it hangs from the bottom of a branch
swaying ever so slightly theres something else
among the familiar evening sounds of the woods my
ears register a low hum then i know its a wasp
nest
fear shoots through me but i have enough sense to
keep still after all i dont know what kind of wasp
lives there it could be the ordinary leaveusalone
andwellleaveyoualone type but these are the
hunger games and ordinary isnt the norm more
likely they will be one of the capitols muttations
tracker j ackers like the jabberjays thesekiller wasps
were spawned in a lab and strategically placed like
land mines around the districts during the war
larger than regular wasps they have a distinctive
solid gold body and a sting that raises a lump the size
of a plum on contact most people cant tolerate more
than a few stings some die at once if you live the
hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually
driven people to madness and theres another thing
these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs
their nest and attempt to kill them thats where the
tracker part of the name comes from
after the war the capitol destroyed all the nests
surrounding their city but the ones near the districts
were left untouched another reminder of our
weakness i suppose just like the hunger games
another reason to keep inside the fence of district 12

when gale and i come across a tracker jacker nest
we immediately head in the opposite direction
so is that what hangs above me i look back to rue
for help but shes melted into her tree
given my circumstances i guess it doesnt matter
what type of wasp nest it is im wounded and
trapped darkness has given me a brief reprieve but
by the time the sun rises the careers will have
formulated a plan to kill me theres no way they
could do otherwise after ive made them look so
stupid that nest may be the sole option i have left if
i can drop it down on them i may be able to escape
but ill risk my life in the process
of course ill never be able to get in close enough to
the actual nest to cut it free ill have to saw off the
branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down
the serrated portion of my knife should be able to
manage that but can my hands and will the
vibration from the sawing raise the swarm and what
if the careers figure out what im doing and move
their camp that would defeat the whole purpose
i realize that the best chance ill have to do the sawing
without drawing notice will be during the anthem
that could begin any time i drag myself out of my
bag make sure my knife is secured in my belt and
begin to make my way up the tree this in itself is
dangerous since the branches are becoming
precariously thin even for me but i persevere when i
reach the limb that supports the nest the humming
becomes more distinctive but its still oddly subdued
if these are tracker jackers its the smoke i think its
sedated them this was the one defense the rebels
found to battle the wasps

the seal of the capitol shines above me and the
anthem blares out its now or never i think and
begin to saw blisters burst on my right hand as i
awkwardly drag the knife back and forth once ive
got a groove the work requires less effort but is
almost more than i can handle i grit my teeth and
saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register
that there were no deaths today thats all right the
audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed
and the pack below me but the anthems running
out and im only three quarters of the way through
the wood when the music ends the sky goes dark
and im forced to stop
now what i could probably finish off the job by sense
of feel but that may not be the smartest plan if the
wasps are too groggy if the nest catches on its way
down if i try to escape this could all be a deadly
waste of time better i think to sneak up here at
dawn and send the nest into my enemies
in the faint light of the careers torches i inch back
down to my fork to find the best surprise ive ever
had sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot
attached to a silver parachute my first gift from a
sponsor haymitch must have had it sent in during
the anthem the pot easily fits in the palm of my
hand what can it be not food surely i unscrew the
lid and i know by the scent that its medicine
cautiously i probe the surface of the ointment the
throbbing in my fingertip vanishes
oh haymitch i whisper thank you he has not
abandoned me not left me to fend entirely for myself
the cost of this medicine must be astronomical
probably not one but many sponsors have
contributed to buy this one tiny pot to me it is
priceless
